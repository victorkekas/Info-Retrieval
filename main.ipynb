      "Text: covid super spreaders definitional quandaries and implications uncertainty around the role super spreaders play in the transmission and escalation of infectious disease is compounded by its broad and vague definition it is a term that has been much used in relation to covid particularly in social media on its widest definition it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people given the biological behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease it can potentially be used to describe events policies or settings this article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic one problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged super spreaders another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of covid transmission the author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition\n",
