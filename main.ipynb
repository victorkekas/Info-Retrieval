      "Text: ace inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers and severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus some authors recently suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs should be discontinued even temporarily given the current pandemic of sars cov virus the suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ace inhibitors and arbs may favor the entry and diffusion of sars cov virus into the human cells ace inhibitors and arbs may increase the expression of ace receptors which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism ace receptors are ubiquitous although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type pneumocytes type pneumocytes are small cylindrical alveolar cells located in close vicinity to pulmonary capillaries and responsible for the synthesis of alveolar surfactant which is known to facilitate gas exchanges the increased expression of ace for effect of ace inhibitors and arbs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin and mrna related to ace there is the fear that the increased expression of ace induced by ace inhibitors and arbs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the sars cov virus however there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis furthermore available data are conflicting and some counter intuitive findings suggest that arbs may be beneficial not harmful indeed studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ace receptors show a down regulation i e the opposite of what would happen with ace inhibitors and arbs for effect of their interaction with the virus in animal studies down regulation of ace has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus but not in the surrounding areas in these studies virus induced ace down regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin because ace degrades angiotensin ii into angiotensin with consequent accumulation of angiotensin ii the excess angiotensin ii would favor pulmonary edema and inflammation a phenomenon directly associated with angiotensin ii levels along with worsening in pulmonary function such detrimental effects have been blocked by arbs in experimental models in the light of the above considerations it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ace inhibitors or arbs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of sars cov virus is not based on clinical evidence conversely experimental studies suggest that arbs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type angiotensin ii receptors controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited this review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ace inhibitors and arbs in the setting of the sars cov pandemic\n",
