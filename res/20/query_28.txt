Text: similar incidence of coronavirus disease covid in patients with rheumatic diseases with and without hydroxychloroquine therapy background hydroxychloroquine is currently being tested as post exposure prophylaxis against coronavirus disease covid in several ongoing clinical trials objective to compare the incidence of covid in spanish patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases treated with and without hydroxychloroquine methods retrospective electronic record review from february th to april th of patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases followed at two academic tertiary care hospitals in seville spain the cumulative incidence of covid confirmed or suspected was compared between patients with and without hydroxychloroquine as part of their treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases results among included subjects were receiving hydroxychloroquine during the seven week study period five ci cases of covid were registered among patients with hydroxychloroquine and five p in without hydroxychloroquine covid was confirmed by pcr in one ci patient with hydroxychloroquine and two ci without hydroxychloroquine p one patient on hydroxychloroquine and two subjects without hydroxychloroquine were admitted to the hospital none of them required to be transferred to the intensive care unit and no patient died during the episode conclusions the incidence and severity of covid among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases with and without hydroxychloroquine was not significantly different hydroxychloroquine does not seem to be an appropriate therapy for post exposure prophylaxis against covid
