Text: an econometric analysis of sars and avian flu on international tourist arrivals to asia abstract this paper compares the impacts of sars and human deaths arising from avian flu on international tourist arrivals to asia the effects of sars and human deaths from avian flu are compared directly according to the number of human deaths the nature of the short run and long run relationship is examined empirically by estimating a static line fixed effect model and a difference transformation dynamic model respectively empirical results from the static fixed effect and difference transformation dynamic models are consistent and indicate that both the short run and long run sars effect have a more significant impact on international tourist arrivals than does avian flu in addition the effects of deaths arising from both sars and avian flu suggest that sars is more important to international tourist arrivals than is avian flu thus while avian flu is here to stay its effect is currently not as significant as that of sars

Text: pollen explains flu like and covid seasonality current models for flu like epidemics insufficiently explain multi cycle seasonality meteorological factors alone do not predict seasonality given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu like epidemics or covid pollen is documented to be antiviral and allergenic play a role in immuno activation and seems to create a bio aerosol lowering the reproduction number of flu like viruses therefore we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu like epidemics including covid we tested the pollen flu seasonality theory for flu like seasons including covid in the netherlands with its million inhabitants we combined changes in flu like incidence per k dutch citizens code ili with weekly pollen counts and meteorological data for the same period finally a discrete predictive model is tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values displaying inhibitory effects on flu like incidence we found a highly significant inverse association of r between pollen and changes in flu like incidence corrected for incubation period confirming our expectations for the covid season we found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu like incidence of r p when pollen thresholds of total pollen grains m per week allergenic pollen grains m per week and a solar radiation threshold of j cm are passed the passing of at least the pollen thresholds preludes the beginning and end of flu like seasons solar radiation is a supportive factor temperature makes no difference and relative humidity associates even with flu like incidence increases we conclude that pollen is a predictor for the inverse seasonality of flu like epidemics including covid and solar radiation is a co inhibitor the observed seasonality of covid during spring suggests that covid may revive in the netherlands after week the start being preceded by the relative absence of pollen and follows standard pollen flu seasonality patterns

Text: public views of the uk media and government reaction to the swine flu pandemic background the first cases of influenza a h n swine flu were confirmed in the uk on th april after a novel virus first identified in mexico rapidly evolved into a pandemic the swine flu outbreak was the first pandemic in more than years and for many their first encounter with a major influenza outbreak this study examines public understandings of the pandemic exploring how people deciphered the threat and perceived they could control the risks methods purposive sampling was used to recruit seventy three people women and men to take part in focus group discussions around the time of the second wave in swine flu cases results these discussions showed that there was little evidence of the public over reacting that people believed the threat of contracting swine flu was inevitable and that they assessed their own self efficacy for protecting against it to be low respondents assessed a greater risk to their health from the vaccine than from the disease such findings could have led to apathy about following the uk governments recommended health protective behaviours and a sub optimal level of vaccine uptake more generally people were confused about the difference between seasonal influenza and swine flu and their vaccines conclusions this research suggests a gap in public understandings which could hinder attempts to communicate about novel flu viruses in the future there was general support for the government s handling of the pandemic although its public awareness campaign was deemed ineffectual as few people changed their current hand hygiene practices there was less support for the media who were deemed to have over reported the swine flu pandemic

Text: pollen likely seasonal factor in inhibiting flu like epidemics a dutch study into the inverse relation between pollen counts hay fever and flu like incidence there is uncertainty if current models for the covid pandemic should already take into account seasonality that is because current environmental factors do not provide a powerful explanation of such seasonality especially given climate differences between countries with moderate climates it is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked pollen count pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu like viruses to survive outside a host this dutch study confirms that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence as measured by prescribed medication revenues and weekly flu consults this supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu like epidemics if seasonality will be observed during the covid spread as well it is not unlikely that pollen play a role
