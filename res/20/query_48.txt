Text: infection prevention guidelines and considerations for paediatric risk groups when reopening primary schools during covid pandemic norway april in response to the coronavirus disease covid pandemic most countries implemented school closures in norway schools closed on march the evidence of effect on disease transmission was limited while negative consequences were evident before reopening risk assessment for paediatric risk groups was performed concluding that most children can attend school with few conditions requiring preventative homeschooling we here present infection prevention and control guidelines for primary schools and recommendations for paediatric risk groups

Text: shut and re open the role of schools in the spread of covid in europe we investigate the effect of school closure and subsequent reopening on the transmission of covid by considering denmark norway sweden and german states as case studies by comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalisations or confirmed cases under different interventions we provide evidence that the effect of school closure is visible as a reduction in the growth rate approximately days after implementation limited school attendance such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups does not appear to significantly affect community transmission a large scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible in countries such as denmark or norway where community transmission is generally low however school reopening can contribute to significant increases in the growth rate in countries like germany where community transmission is relatively high our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies that ensure low classroom occupancy and a solid infrastructure to quickly identify and isolate new infections

Text: expected impact of reopening schools after lockdown on covid epidemic in ile de france as several countries around the world are planning exit strategies to progressively lift the rigid social restrictions implemented with lockdown different options are being chosen regarding the closure or reopening of schools we evaluate the expected impact of reopening schools in lie de france region after the withdrawal of lockdown currently scheduled for may we explore several scenarios of partial progressive or full school reopening coupled with moderate social distancing interventions and large scale tracing testing and isolation accounting for current uncertainty on the role of children in covid epidemic we test different hypotheses on children s transmissibility distinguishing between younger children pre school and primary school age and adolescents middle and high school age reopening schools after lifting lockdown will likely lead to an increase in the number of covid cases in the following months even with lower transmissibility of children yet protocols exist that would allow maintaining the epidemic under control without saturating the healthcare system with pre schools and primary schools in session starting may icu occupation would reach at most probability ranges of a bed capacity here foreseen as the routine capacity restored in the region post first wave if no other school level reopens before summer or if middle and high schools reopen one month later through a progressive protocol increasing attendance week by week full attendance of adolescents at school starting in june would overwhelm the icu system occupation reopening all schools on may would likely lead to a second wave similar to the one recently experienced except if maximum attendance is limited to for both younger children and adolescents based on the estimated situation on may no substantial difference in the epidemic risk is predicted between progressive and prompt reopening of pre schools and primary schools thus allowing full attendance of younger children mostly in need of resuming learning and development reopening would require however large scale trace and testing to promptly isolate cases in addition to moderate social distancing interventions full attendance in middle and high schools is instead not recommended findings are consistent across different assumptions on the relative transmissibility of younger children and for small increase of the reproductive number possibly due to decreasing compliance to lockdown

Text: the impact of school reopening on the spread of covid in england background in the uk cases of covid have been declining since mid april and there is good evidence to suggest that the effective reproduction number has dropped below leading to a multi phase relaxation plan for the country to emerge from lockdown as part of this staggered process primary schools are scheduled to partially reopen on st june evidence from a range of sources suggests that children are in general only mildly affected by the disease and have low mortality rates though there is less certainty regarding children s role in transmission therefore there is wide discussion on the impact of reopening schools methods we compare eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in england from st june focusing on the return of particular year groups and the associated epidemic consequences this is assessed through model simulation modifying a previously developed dynamic transmission model for sars cov we quantify how the process of reopening schools affected contact patterns and anticipated secondary infections the relative change in r according to the extent of school reopening and determine the public health impact via estimated change in clinical cases and its sensitivity to decreases in adherence post strict lockdown findings whilst reopening schools in any form results in more mixing between children an increase in r and hence transmission of the disease the magnitude of that increase can be low dependent upon the age groups that return to school and the behaviour of the remaining population we predict that reopening schools in a way that allows half class sizes or that is focused on younger children is unlikely to push r above one although there is noticeable variation between the regions of the country given that older children have a greater number of social contacts and hence a greater potential for transmission our findings suggest reopening secondary schools results in larger increases in case burden than only reopening primary schools reopening both generates the largest increase and could push r above one in some regions the impact of less social distancing in the rest of the population generally has far larger effects than reopening schools and exacerbates the impacts of reopening discussion our work indicates that any reopening of schools will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population although the opening of schools alone is unlikely to push the value of r above one however impacts of other recent relaxations of lockdown measures are yet to be quantified suggesting some regions may be closer to the critical threshold that would lead to a growth in cases given the uncertainties in part due to limited data on covid in children school reopening should be carefully monitored ultimately the decision about reopening classrooms is a difficult trade off between increased epidemiological consequences and the emotional educational and developmental needs of children

Text: little risk of the covid resurgence on students in china outside hubei caused by school reopening objective school reopening has not yet started in china where the covid outbreak has reached ending stage largely due to a great concern about covid infections on students we attempted to quantitatively evaluate the risk of covid infections on students caused by school reopening study design we collected the data of the numbers of teachers population size and newly confirmed covid cases in the past days in typical provinces cities of china and then analyzed the risk of covid infections in schools with respect to each province city methods a step by step procedure was explored to calculate the probability of covid infections on students as transmitted from infected teachers two critical assumptions for analysis were proposed i only locally generated cases were counted while imported cases were omitted ii the secondary attack rate of the covid virus in schools is similar to that in households in china ranging from results the probability of covid resurgence within one week on students of primary middle and high schools in china outside hubei is extremely low in each province city and such probability can be updated daily and weekly based on the newly confirmed cases in the past days in some areas without newly confirmed cases in the past days the risk is zero conclusions our work provides guidance for local governments to make risk level based policies for school reopening currently the risk of covid infections on students is extremely low in china outside hubei and therefore school reopening can be initiated without the endanger of infections on students

Text: no evidence of secondary transmission of covid from children attending school in ireland as many countries begin to lift some of the restrictions to contain covid spread lack of evidence of transmission in the school setting remains we examined irish notifications of sars cov in the school setting before school closures on march and identified no paediatric transmission this adds to current evidence that children do not appear to be drivers of transmission and we argue that reopening schools should be considered safe accompanied by certain measures

Text: how to safely reopen colleges and universities during covid experiences from taiwan reopening colleges and universities during the coronavirus disease covid pandemic poses a special challenge worldwide taiwan is one of the few countries where schools are functioning normally to secure the safety of students and staff the ministry of education in taiwan established general guidelines for college campuses the guidelines delineated creation of a task force at each university school based risk screening based on travel history occupation contacts and clusters measures on self management of health and quarantine general hygiene measures including wearing masks indoors principles on ventilation and sanitization regulations on school assemblies a process for reporting suspected cases and policies on school closing and make up classes it also announced that a class should be suspended if student or staff member in it tested positive and that a school should be closed for days if it had or more confirmed cases as of june there have been confirmed cases in taiwanese universities since the start of the pandemic one university was temporarily closed adopted virtual classes and quickly reopened after days of contact tracing and quarantine of possible contacts taiwan s experience suggests that under certain circumstances safely reopening colleges and universities this fall may be feasible with a combination of strategies that include containment access control with contact tracing and quarantine and mitigation hygiene sanitation ventilation and social distancing practices

Text: determining the optimal strategy for reopening schools work and society in the uk balancing earlier opening and the impact of test and trace strategies with the risk of occurrence of a secondary covid pandemic wave background in order to slow down the spread of sars cov the virus causing the covid pandemic the uk government has imposed strict physical distancing lockdown measures including school dismissals since march as evidence is emerging that these measures may have slowed the spread of the pandemic it is important to assess the impact of any changes in strategy including scenarios for school reopening and broader relaxation of social distancing this work uses an individual based model to predict the impact of a suite of possible strategies to reopen schools in the uk including that currently proposed by the uk government methods we use covasim a stochastic agent based model for transmission of covid calibrated to the uk epidemic the model describes individuals contact networks stratified as household school work and community layers and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the uk we simulate a range of different school reopening strategies with a society wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of different non pharmaceutical interventions to estimate the number of new infections cumulative cases and deaths as well as the effective reproduction number with different strategies to account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under years old compared to older ages findings we found that with increased levels of testing of people between and of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active covid infection depending on scenarios and effective contact tracing and isolation for infected individuals an epidemic rebound may be prevented across all reopening scenarios with the effective reproduction number r remaining below one and the cumulative number of new infections and deaths significantly lower than they would be if testing did not increase if uk schools reopen in phases from june prevention of a second wave would require testing of symptomatic infections tracing of of their contacts and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases however without such measures reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave as are other scenarios for reopening when infectiousness of year olds was varied from to of that of older ages our findings remained unchanged interpretation to prevent a secondary covid wave relaxation of social distancing including reopening schools in the uk must be implemented alongside an active large scale population wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts followed by isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals such combined measures have a greater likelihood of controlling the transmission of sars cov and preventing a large number of covid deaths than reopening schools and society with the current level of implementation of testing and isolation of infected individuals
