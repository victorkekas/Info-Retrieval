Text: covid serological tests how well do they actually perform in only a few months after initial discovery in wuhan china sars cov and the associated coronavirus disease covid have become a global pandemic causing significant mortality and morbidity and implementation of strict isolation measures in the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutics reliable serological testing must be a key element of public health policy to control further spread of the disease and gradually remove quarantine measures serological diagnostic tests are being increasingly used to provide a broader understanding of covid incidence and to assess immunity status in the population however there are discrepancies between claimed and actual performance data for serological diagnostic tests on the market in this study we conducted a review of independent studies evaluating the performance of sars cov serological tests we found significant variability in the accuracy of marketed tests and highlight several lab based and point of care rapid serological tests with high levels of performance the findings of this review highlight the need for ongoing independent evaluations of commercialized covid diagnostic tests
