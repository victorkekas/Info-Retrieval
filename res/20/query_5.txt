Text: the importance of animal models in the development of vaccines efficient translation of basic vaccine research into clinical therapies greatly depends upon the availability of appropriate animal models testing novel vaccine candidates in animal models is a critical step in the development of modern vaccines animal models are being used to assess the quality and quantity of the immune response to identify the optimal route of delivery and formulation to determine protection from infection and disease transmission and to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the vaccine formulation animal models help to make the translation from basic research to clinical application and they often allow prediction of the vaccine potential which helps in predicting the financial risks for vaccine manufacturers choosing an appropriate animal model has become increasingly important for the field as each model has its own advantages and disadvantages in this review the criteria for selecting the right animal model the advantages and disadvantages of various animal models as well as the future needs for animal models are being discussed

Text: animal models for the study of neuroimmunological disease the development and use of numerous animal models of human autoimmune diseases have provided important advances in our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of disease and provided robust and reliable models to test novel therapeutic strategies however few preclinical studies of therapeutic treatments have demonstrated efficacy in the clinic possibly because of the biological differences between humans and other animals although animal models of human disease are imperfect it is important to understand the differences between the human disease and its animal models and to design experimental studies using animal models appropriately for the questions being asked this review provides an overview of the currently used animal models of three human neuroimmunological diseases multiple sclerosis guillain barré syndrome and myasthenia gravis as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each model and how they correlate or differ from their human counterpart
