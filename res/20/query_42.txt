Text: association of vitamin d deficiency and treatment with covid incidence importance vitamin d treatment has been found to decrease incidence of viral respiratory tract infection especially in vitamin d deficiency it is unknown whether covid incidence is associated with vitamin d deficiency and treatment objective to examine whether vitamin d deficiency and treatment are associated with testing positive for covid design retrospective cohort study setting university of chicago medicine participants patients tested for covid from vitamin d deficiency was defined by the most recent hydroxycholecalciferol ng ml or dihydroxycholecalciferol pg ml within year before covid testing treatment was defined by the most recent vitamin d type and dose and treatment changes between the time of the most recent vitamin d level and time of covid testing vitamin d deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize vitamin d status at the time of covid testing as likely deficient last level deficient treatment not increased likely sufficient last level not deficient treatment not decreased or uncertain deficiency last level deficient treatment increased or last level not deficient treatment decreased main outcomes and measures the main outcome was testing positive for covid multivariable analysis tested whether the most recent vitamin d level and treatment changes after that level were associated with testing positive for covid controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators bivariate analyses of associations of treatment with vitamin d deficiency and covid were performed results among patients tested for covid had a vitamin d level in the year before testing vitamin d status at the time of covid testing was categorized as likely deficient for patients likely sufficient for patients and uncertain for patients in multivariate analysis testing positive for covid was associated with increasing age rr age p rr age p non white race rr p and being likely vitamin d deficient deficient treatment not increased rr p as compared to likely vitamin d sufficient not deficient treatment not decreased with predicted covid rates in the vitamin d deficient group of ci versus ci in the vitamin d sufficient group vitamin d deficiency declined with increasing vitamin d dose especially of vitamin d vitamin d dose was not significantly associated with testing positive for covid conclusions and relevance vitamin d deficiency that is not sufficiently treated is associated with covid risk testing and treatment for vitamin d deficiency to address covid warrant aggressive pursuit and study

Text: potential role of vitamin d in the elderly to resist covid and to slow progression of parkinson s disease while we are still learning more about covid caused by the novel sars cov virus finding alternative and already available methods to reduce the risk and severity of the disease is paramount one such option is vitamin d in the form of vitamin d cholecalciferol supplementation due to its potential antiviral properties it has become apparent that older individuals have a greater risk of developing severe covid and compared to younger adults the elderly have lower levels of vitamin d due to a variety of biological and behavioral factors older adults are also more likely to be diagnosed with parkinson s disease pd with advanced age being the single greatest risk factor in addition to its immune system modulating effects it has been suggested that vitamin d supplementation plays a role in slowing pd progression and improving pd related quality of life we completed a review of the literature to determine the relationship between vitamin d pd and covid we concluded that the daily supplementation of iu day of vitamin d in older adults with pd has the potential to slow the progression of pd while also potentially offering additional protection against covid
