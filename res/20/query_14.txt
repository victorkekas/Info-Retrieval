Text: a super spreader of covid in ningbo city in china an outbreak of coronavirus disease covid has spread rapidly it is imperative to control the epidemic by understanding the epidemiological feature preventative quarantine and effective hygiene measures in the present study we report a case of super spreader who transmitted the disease to over twenty eight persons in ningbo zhejiang identifying and isolated super spreaders understanding the reasons behind the efficient transmission ability are important for the control and management of the ongoing covid pandemic

Text: significance of super spreader events in covid the number of secondary cases from each primary case determines how fast an epidemic grows it is known that all cases do not spread the infection equally super spreaders play an important role as they contribute disproportionately to a much larger number of cases including in the ongoing covid pandemic super spreaders have been reported for more than a century but limited information is available in scientific literature an epidemic containment strategy needs to include early identification of super spreaders to limit an explosive growth super spreaders tend to get stigmatized resulting in late reporting and hiding of cases it is important for program managers to be sensitive to the manner in which related information is shared with media and general public

Text: super spreader businesses and risk of covid transmission purpose the united states has the highest number of confirmed covid cases in the world to date with over covid related deaths the true risk of a covid resurgence as states prepare to reopen businesses is unknown this paper aims to classify businesses by their risk of transmission and quantify the relationship between the density of super spreader businesses and covid cases methods we constructed a covid business transmission risk index based upon the frequency and duration of visits and square footage of businesses pre pandemic in in states massachusetts rhode island connecticut new hampshire vermont maine new york and california we used this index to classify businesses as super spreaders then we analyzed the association between the density of super spreader businesses in a county and the rate of covid cases we performed significance testing using a negative binomial regression the main outcome of interest is the cumulative number of covid cases each week results we found a positive association between the density of super spreader businesses and covid cases a percentage point increase in the density of super spreader businesses is associated with higher covid cases all else equal conclusion higher densities of super spreader businesses are associated with higher rates of covid cases this may have important implications for how states reopen super spreader businesses

Text: spatial super spreaders and super susceptibles in human movement networks as lockdowns and stay at home orders start to be lifted across the globe governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies in dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging if not practically impossible governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading indeed certain places like some people can be super spreaders is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs here we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super spreaders and the novel concept of super susceptibles i e respectively places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it our proposed data analytic framework is based on the daily aggregated ridership data of public transport in singapore by constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics we are able to pinpoint super spreader and super susceptible locations our results reveal that most super spreaders are also super susceptibles and that counterintuitively busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations our analysis is based on data from singapore but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center it therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness

Text: risk factors for transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection during the outbreak in south korea background transmission heterogeneity was observed during the korean outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov infection only of cases transmitted the infection and super spreading events caused transmissions we investigated the risk factors for mers cov transmission methods epidemiological reports were used to classify patients as nonspreaders spreaders or those associated with a super spreading event or more transmissions logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the factors for mers cov transmission results compared to nonspreaders spreaders exhibited a longer interval from symptom onset to isolation days vs days and more frequent pre isolation pneumonia diagnoses vs spreaders also exhibited higher values for pre isolation contacts vs pre isolation hospitalization vs and emergency room er visits vs spreaders exhibited lower cycle thresholds for the upe and orf a genes vs and vs respectively in multivariate analysis transmission was independently associated with the cycle threshold odds ratio or confidence interval ci and pre isolation hospitalization or er visits or ci the super spreading events exhibited higher values for pre isolation contacts vs pre isolation er visits vs and doctor shopping vs compared to non super spreading events conclusions these findings indicate that transmission is determined by host infectivity and the number of contacts whereas super spreading events were determined by the number of contacts and hospital visits these relationships highlight the importance of rapidly enforcing infection control measures to prevent outbreaks

Text: covid super spreaders definitional quandaries and implications uncertainty around the role super spreaders play in the transmission and escalation of infectious disease is compounded by its broad and vague definition it is a term that has been much used in relation to covid particularly in social media on its widest definition it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people given the biological behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease it can potentially be used to describe events policies or settings this article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic one problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged super spreaders another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of covid transmission the author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition
