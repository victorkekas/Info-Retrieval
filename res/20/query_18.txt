Text: covid face masks and human to human transmission in december transmission of the novel coronavirus sars cov that causes coronavirus disease covid occurred in wuhan china and later the virus began to be transmitted from person to person face masks are a type of personal protective equipment used to prevent the spread of respiratory infections it may be effective at helping prevent transmission of respiratory viruses and bacteria here we share a case of face masks are be used to prevent the transmission of covid infection

Text: covid emerging protective measures the covid coronavirus disease spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose covid is predominantly considered as an unavoidable pandemic and scientists are very curious about how to provide the best protection to the public before a vaccine can be made available there is an urge to manufacture a greater number of masks to prevent any aerosol with microbes hence we aim to develop an efficient viral inactivation system by exploiting active compounds from naturally occurring medicinal plants and infusing them into nanofiber based respiratory masks our strategy is to develop fibrous filtration with three layered masks using the compounds from medicinal plants for viral deactivation these masks will be beneficial not just to healthcare workers but common citizens as well in the absence of vaccination productive masks can be worn to prevent transmission of airborne pathogenic aerosols and control diseases

Text: estimating the effect and cost effectiveness of facemasks in reducing the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in uganda evidence that face masks provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce however face masks are widely used by health workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections it would therefore be reasonable to suggest that consistent widespread use of face masks in the community could prevent further spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in this study we examine public face mask wearing in uganda where a proportion wears masks to protect against acquiring and the other to prevent from transmitting sars cov the objective of this study was to determine what percentage of the population would have to wear face masks to reduce susceptibility to and infectivity of covid in uganda keeping the basic reproduction number below unity and or flattening the curve we used an seiaqrd model for the analysis results show that implementation of facemasks has a relatively large impact on the size of the coronavirus epidemic in uganda we find that the critical mask adherence is per when wear face masks a cost effective analysis shows that utilizing funds to provide public mask to the population has a per capita compounded cost of usd if provision of face masks is done simultaneously with supportive care the per capita compounded cost is usd while for the case of only treatment and no provision of face masks costs each ugandan usd we conclude that since it is hard to achieve a adherence to face masks government might consider provision of face masks in conjunction with provision of care

Text: do face masks create a false sense of security a covid dilemma face masks have become an emblem of the public response to covid with many governments mandating their use in public spaces the logic is that face masks are low cost and might help prevent some transmission however from the start the assumption that face masks are low cost was questioned early on there were warnings of the opportunity cost of public use of medical masks given shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers this led to recommendations for cloth masks and other face coverings with little evidence of their ability to prevent transmission however there may also be a high cost to these recommendations if people rely on face masks in place of other more effective ways to break transmission such as staying home we use safegraph smart device location data to show that the representative american in states that have face mask mandates spent minutes less time at home and increase visits to a number of commercial locations following the mandate since the reproductive rate of sar cov the pathogen that causes covid is hovering right around one such substitution behavior could be the difference between controlling the epidemic and a resurgence of cases

Text: testing the efficacy of homemade masks would they protect in an influenza pandemic objective this study examined homemade masks as an alternative to commercial face masks methods several household materials were evaluated for the capacity to block bacterial and viral aerosols twenty one healthy volunteers made their own face masks from cotton t shirts the masks were then tested for fit the number of microorganisms isolated from coughs of healthy volunteers wearing their homemade mask a surgical mask or no mask was compared using several air sampling techniques results the median fit factor of the homemade masks was one half that of the surgical masks both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers although the surgical mask was times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask conclusion our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals but it would be better than no protection disaster med public health preparedness

Text: universal masking during covid pandemic current evidence and controversies the emergence of coronavirus disease pandemic and novel research on the high transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov has raised controversies over the use of face masks to prevent community transmission specific regulations need to be fulfilled to use a face mask as part of the personal protective equipment and high quality of evidence supporting its use to prevent respiratory viral infections including sars cov is lacking however its widespread use is becoming a standard practice in some countries and discrepancies between health authorities on their policy have led to controversy the aim of this review is to provide an outlook on recent research in this matter and areas of opportunity
