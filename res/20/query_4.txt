Text: on the corona infection model with contact restriction this article presents a mathematical infection model that is designed to estimate the course of coronavirus infection in germany for several days in advance how many people become ill or die what is the temporal development if the contact restriction is perfect then the model predicts the development of the virus infection after the initial subsidence of the infection however since this restriction cannot always be strictly adhered to the model is dynamically adapted to the development this makes it possible to estimate the number of infected people the number of new infections and deaths in germany about a week in advance

Text: coronavirus optimization algorithm a bioinspired metaheuristic based on the covid propagation model a novel bioinspired metaheuristic is proposed in this work simulating how the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people from an initial individual the patient zero the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates creating new populations of infected people every individual can either die or infect and afterwards be sent to the recovered population relevant terms such as re infection probability super spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity the coronavirus optimization algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies first the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values second the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations without setting this value either infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations furthermore a parallel multi virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations finally the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase as application case the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed showing quite remarkable performance

Text: how fear appeal approaches in covid health communication may be harming the global community as health professionals develop health communication for coronavirus disease covid we implore that these communication approaches do not include fear appeals fear appeals also known as scare tactics have been widely used to promote recommended preventive behaviors we contend that unintended negative outcomes can result from fear appeals that intensify the already complex pandemic and efforts to contain it we encourage public health professionals to reevaluate their desire to use fear appeals in covid health communication and recommend that evidence based health communication be utilized to address the needs of a specific community help people understand what they are being asked to do explain step by step how to complete preventative behaviors and consider external factors needed to support the uptake of behaviors to aid health professionals in redirecting away from the use of fear appeals we offer a phased approach to creating health communication messages during the covid crisis

Text: health psychology the chapter draws parallels and contrasts between the study of health in north american and other industrialized countries and health of people living in developing countries which comprise of the world s population lessons are provided for three common health problems where psychologists play a major role within multidisciplinary teams the lessons use published journal articles web sites of international organizations and the author s personal experiences living and working in developing countries one topic concerns the large number of women who unnecessarily die in childbirth and the non medical reasons the second is environmental health which includes sources of clean water waste disposal and personal hygiene solving this problem requires behavior change the third concerns child hunger and its disabling effects on cognitive development the focus of this chapter is on examining the health problem within context and identifying solutions that work and do not work background is provided for the novice so students learn the larger picture into which these issues fit and how to apply the same analysis to other health problems

Text: behavioral welfare economics a growing body of normative work explores whether and how deference to people s choices might be reconciled with behavioral findings about human error this work has strong implications for economic analysis of law cost benefit analysis and regulatory policy in light of behavioral findings regulators should adopt a working presumption in favor of respect for people s self regarding choices but only if those choices are adequately informed and sufficiently free from behavioral biases the working presumption should itself be rebuttable on welfare grounds with an understanding that the ends that people choose might make their lives go less well for example people might die prematurely or suffer from serious illness and what they receive in return might not on any plausible account of welfare be nearly enough the underlying reason might involve a lack of information or a behavioral bias identifiable or not in which case intervention can fit with the working presumption but the real problem might involve philosophical questions about the proper understanding of welfare and about what it means for people to have a good life
