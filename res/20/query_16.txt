Text: how long does coronavirus survive on different surfaces dental practices now need to be more vigilant than ever and pay extra attention to hygiene in the surgery hospitals are currently operating an hourly total clean policy and it would be prudent for dental practices to look to operate something similar to reduce the possibility of viral transmission the government is encouraging people to stay at home and maintain social distancing during the pandemic however key workers must go to work use public transport and mix with high risk people people also need to go to supermarkets to get their groceries the surfaces in these public places are likely to be contaminated these germs can then be brought into homes or dental practices

Text: how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces a systematic review background inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces methods the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions in addition cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included results most gram positive bacteria such as enterococcus spp including vre staphylococcus aureus including mrsa or streptococcus pyogenes survive for months on dry surfaces many gram negative species such as acinetobacter spp escherichia coli klebsiella spp pseudomonas aeruginosa serratia marcescens or shigella spp can also survive for months a few others such as bordetella pertussis haemophilus influenzae proteus vulgaris or vibrio cholerae however persist only for days mycobacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis and spore forming bacteria including clostridium difficile can also survive for months on surfaces candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to months on surfaces persistence of other yeasts such as torulopsis glabrata was described to be similar months or shorter candida parapsilosis days most viruses from the respiratory tract such as corona coxsackie influenza sars or rhino virus can persist on surfaces for a few days viruses from the gastrointestinal tract such as astrovirus hav polio or rota virus persist for approximately months blood borne viruses such as hbv or hiv can persist for more than one week herpes viruses such as cmv or hsv type and have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to days conclusion the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed

Text: droplet evaporation residue indicating sars cov survivability on surfaces sars cov survives and remains viable on surfaces for several days under different environments as reported in recent studies however it is unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies across different surfaces to address these questions we conduct systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human exhaled gas on surfaces we found that these droplets do not disappear with evaporation but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers referred to as residues persist for more than hours and are highly durable against changes of environmental conditions the characteristics of these residues change significantly across surface types specifically surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable residues while stainless steel plastic and glass surfaces form residues from a varying fraction of all deposited droplets at relative humidity lowering humidity level suppresses the formation of residues while increasing humidity level enhances it our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes allowing them to survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition our findings can also be extended to other viruses transmitted through respiratory droplets e g sars cov flu viruses etc and can thus lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces and other prevention measures e g humidity control for limiting viral transmission

Text: can homeopathy a particularly mild therapeutic approach survive and grow in a world of violence this short treatise addresses a philosophical question concerning the place of homeopathy in our modern world the question raised is whether a therapeutic system as peaceful mild and non violent as homeopathy can survive and grow within a society that often displays the opposite characteristics much of contemporary society is more interested in fast and impressive cures even if these may also bring side effects whereas homeopathy can offer solutions with a personalized approach that requires long hours of case study by the homeopath to find the correct personal remedy that aims to bring about positive results which the therapy can produce in deep chronic diseases the conclusion drawn is that homeopathy does not readily fit within a modern and violent society that prefers quick and invasive solutions to its clinical problems
