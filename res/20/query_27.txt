Text: clinical outcome of asymptomatic cases at the time of hospital admission infected with sars coronavirus in shenzhen china the journal of infectious diseases oxford academic abstract an epidemic caused by sars coronavirus infection has spread unexpectedly in wuhan hubei province china since december it is rarely reported about asymptomatic cases screened from close contacts we study epidemiological and clinical outcome of asymptomatic carriers who were laboratory confirmed positive for the sars coronavirus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples the evidence showed that asymptomatic carriers occurred more often in middle aged people who had close contact with infected family members the majority of the cases developed to be mild and ordinary covid during hospital

Text: evidence supporting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus while presymptomatic or asymptomatic recent epidemiologic virologic and modeling reports support the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov transmission from persons who are presymptomatic sars cov detected before symptom onset or asymptomatic sars cov detected but symptoms never develop sars cov transmission in the absence of symptoms reinforces the value of measures that prevent the spread of sars cov by infected persons who may not exhibit illness despite being infectious critical knowledge gaps include the relative incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic sars cov infection the public health interventions that prevent asymptomatic transmission and the question of whether asymptomatic sars cov infection confers protective immunity

Text: characteristics of asymptomatic patients with sars cov infection in jinan china coronavirus disease covid caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov is continuously and rapidly circulating at present asymptomatic patients have been proven to be contagious and thus pose a significant infection control challenge here we describe the characteristics of asymptomatic patients with sars cov infection in jinan shandong province china a total of patients with confirmed covid were recruited among them patients were categorized as asymptomatic cases we found that the asymptomatic patients in jinan were relatively young and were mainly clustered cases the laboratory indicators and lung lesion on chest ct were mild no special factors were found accounting for the presence or absence of symptoms the presence of asymptomatic patients increased the difficulty of screening it is necessary to strengthen the identification of such patients in the future

Text: identification of rt pcr negative asymptomatic covid patients via serological testing asymptomatic individuals with coronavirus disease covid have been identified via nucleic acid testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov however the epidemiologic characteristics and viral shedding pattern of asymptomatic patients remain largely unknown in this study serological testing was applied when identifying nine asymptomatic cases of covid who showed persistent negative rt pcr test results for sars cov nucleic acid and no symptoms of covid two asymptomatic cases were presumed to be index patients who had cleared the virus when their close contacts developed symptoms of covid three of the asymptomatic cases were local individuals who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients developed symptoms of covid this report presents the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic individuals with sars cov infection that were undetected on rt pcr tests in previous epidemiologic investigations probably due to the transient viral shedding duration

Text: asymptomatic middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov infection extent and implications for infection control a systematic review abstract background the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov emerged in and attracted an international attention as the virus caused multiple healthcare associated outbreaks there are reports of the role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of mers cov however the exact role is not known method the medline pubmed and scopus databases were searched for relevant papers published till august describing asymptomatic mers cov infection results a total of papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review the extent of asymptomatic mers infection had increased with change in the policy of testing asymptomatic contacts in early cases in april october were asymptomatic among pcr laboratory confirmed mers cov cases while in the proportion rose to among confirmed cases the proportion of asymptomatic cases reported among pediatric confirmed mers cov cases were higher overall the detection rate of mers infection among asymptomatic contacts was in studies included in this review asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition compared to fatal cases of particular interest is that most of the identified pediatric cases were asymptomatic with no clear explanation conclusions the proportion of asymptomatic mers cases were detected with increasing frequency as the disease progressed overtime those patients were less likely to have comorbid disease and may contribute to the transmission of the virus
