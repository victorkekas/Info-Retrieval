Text: ultra sensitive nanozyme based chemiluminescence paper test for rapid diagnosis of sars cov infection the recently emerged coronavirus disease covid has now evolved into a global pandemic early detection is crucial for its effective control nucleic acid testing for viral pathogen and serological testing for host antibodies are playing important roles in current covid diagnosis however while nucleic acid testing is complicated facility restricted and time consuming antibody testing may result in high rates of false negative diagnoses especially during the early stages of viral infection thus a more rapid and reliable test for both early covid diagnosis and whole population screening is urgently needed here we developed a novel nanozyme based chemiluminescence paper assay for rapid and high sensitive testing of sars cov spike antigen our paper test uses a newly established peroxidase mimic co fe hemin nanozyme instead of natural hrp that catalytically amplifies the chemiluminescent signal allowing for target concentrations to be as low as ng ml furthermore our nanozyme based chemiluminescence test exhibits a linear range that is fold wider compared to elisa tests importantly testing is completed in less than min compared to h required for elisa or nucleic acid tests critically signal detection is feasible using a smartphone camera ingredients for our test are simple and readily available rendering overall cost considerably lower than those used in current diagnoses in conclusion our novel test provides a high sensitive point of care testing poct approach for sars cov antigen detection which should greatly increase current early screening capacities for suspected infections and considerably lower demand for national healthcare resources

Text: severe underestimation of covid case numbers effect of epidemic growth rate and test restrictions to understand the scope and development of the covid pandemic knowledge of the number of infected persons is essential often the number of confirmed cases which is based on positive rt pcr test results is regarded as a reasonable indicator however limited covid test capacities in many countries are restricting the amount of testing that can be done this can lead to the implementation of testing policies that restrict access to covid tests and to testing backlogs and delays as a result confirmed case numbers can be significantly lower than the actual number of infections especially during rapid growth phases of the epidemic this study examines the quantitative relation between infections and reported confirmed case numbers for two different testing strategies limited and inclusive testing in relation to the growth rate of the epidemic the results indicate that confirmed case numbers understate the actual number of infections substantially during rapid growth phases where the daily growth rate can reach or exceed as has been seen in many countries the confirmed case numbers under report actual infections by up to to fold
