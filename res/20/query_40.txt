Text: functional analysis of the stem loop s and s structures in the coronavirus utr abstract we designed a series of mutations to separately destabilize two helical stems designated s and s predicted by a covariation based model of the coronavirus utr zust et al mouse hepatitis virus genomes containing three or four nucleotide mutations that destabilize either s or s were viable whereas genomes carrying these mutations in both s and s were not viable a genome carrying these mutations in s and s plus compensatory mutations restoring base pairing yielded a virus with wild type phenotype larger mutations which completely disrupt s or s generated various phenotypes mutations opening up s were lethal disruptions of s generated both viable and lethal mutants genomes carrying the original mutations in s or s plus compensatory mutations restoring base pairing were viable and had robust growth phenotypes these results support the zust model for the coronavirus utr and suggest that the s stem is required for virus viability

Text: prediction of amino acid pairs sensitive to mutations in the spike protein from sars related coronavirus in this study we analyzed the amino acid pairs affected by mutations in two spike proteins from human coronavirus strains e and oc by means of random analysis in order to gain some insight into the possible mutations in the spike protein from sars cov the results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations the larger is the difference between actual and predicted frequencies the higher is the chance of mutation occurring the effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations these findings are identical to our several recent studies i e the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases

Text: evidence for mutations in sars cov italian isolates potentially affecting virus transmission italy is the first western country suffering heavy severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov transmission and disease impact after coronavirus disease pandemia started in china even though the presence of mutations on spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid in italian isolates has been reported the potential impact of these mutations on viral transmission has not been evaluated we have compared sars cov genome sequences from italian patients with virus sequences from chinese patients we focussed upon three nonsynonymous mutations of genes coding for s one and n two viral proteins present in italian isolates and absent in chinese ones using various bioinformatics tools amino acid analysis and changes in three dimensional protein structure suggests the mutations reduce protein stability and particularly for s mutation the enhanced torsional ability of the molecule could favor virus binding to cell receptor s this theoretical interpretation awaits experimental and clinical confirmation

Text: critical sequence hot spots for binding of ncov to ace as evaluated by molecular simulations the novel coronavirus ncov outbreak has put the world on edge causing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths all around the world as of june let alone the societal and economic impacts of the crisis the spike protein of ncov resides on the virion s surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain rbd to the host cell surface receptor protein angiotensin converter enzyme ace our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how ncov recognizes and establishes contacts with ace and its difference with an earlier coronavirus sars cov in via extensive molecular dynamics md simulations numerous mutations have been identified in the rbd of ncov strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world in this study we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other ala scanning mutations on the stability of rbd ace complex it is found that most of the naturally occurring mutations to the rbd either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ace as the wild type ncov this may have implications for high human to human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants furthermore in silico ala scanning and long timescale md simulations highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of rbd and ace that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors from an evolutional perspective this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor sars cov and how it could further evolve to become more infectious

Text: anti frameshifting ligand active against sars coronavirus is resistant to natural mutations of the frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot the coronavirus sars cov causing the covid pandemic uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting prf to control the expression levels of key viral proteins because modulating prf can attenuate viral propagation ligands binding to the viral rna pseudoknot that stimulates prf may prove useful as therapeutics mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic but how they affect prf and the activity of inhibitors is unknown cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the sars cov pseudoknot we studied a panel of mutations in key structural regions most mutations left the prf efficiency unchanged even when base pairing was disrupted but one led to a remarkable three fold decrease suggesting that sars cov propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of prf efficiency than some other viruses examining the effects of one of the few small molecule ligands known to suppress prf significantly in sars cov we found that it did so by similar amounts in all sars cov mutants tested regardless of the basal prf efficiency indicating that the activity of anti frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations these results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting sars cov through modulation of prf

Text: feline coronaviruses associated with feline infectious peritonitis have modifications to spike protein activation sites at two discrete positions feline infectious peritonitis fip is associated with mutations in the feline coronavirus fcov genome that are thought to convert the subclinical feline enteric coronavirus fecv into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv a key feature of fipv not shared with fecv is the productive infection of macrophages therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell tropism such as the spike glycoprotein may play an important role in fip progression in a prior study involving a limited number of samples we have shown an association of fip with mutations in the protease cleavage activation site located between the receptor binding and fusion domains of the fcov spike s s here we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this s s site our larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by fipv at s s are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease cleavage activation site located in the fusion domain s adjacent to the viral fusion peptide overall our data indicate a pattern of mutations across the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions and or altered recognition of critical basic polar amino acid residues needed for virus activation in the enteric tract typically fipvs have substitutions of non polar aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites these changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo
