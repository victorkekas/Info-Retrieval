Text: complexities of viral mutation rates many viruses evolve rapidly this is due in part to their high mutation rates mutation rate estimates for over viruses are currently available here we review the population genetics of virus mutation rates we specifically cover the topics of mutation rate estimation the forces that drive the evolution of mutation rates and how the optimal mutation rate can be context dependent
