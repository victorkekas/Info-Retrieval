Text: association of country wide coronavirus mortality with demographics testing lockdowns and public wearing of masks background wide variation between countries has been noted in per capita mortality from the disease covid caused by the sars cov virus determinants of this variation are not fully understood methods potential predictors of country wide per capita coronavirus related mortality were studied including age sex ratio temperature urbanization viral testing smoking duration of infection lockdowns and public mask wearing norms and policies multivariable linear regression analysis was performed results in univariate but not multivariable analyses prevalence of smoking per capita gross domestic product and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus related mortality in a multivariable analysis of countries urbanization the duration of the infection in the country and percent of the population at least years of age were all positively associated with per capita mortality while duration of mask wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality all p in countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask wearing per capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just each week as compared with each week in remaining countries in the multivariable analysis lockdowns tended to be associated with less mortality p and per capita testing with higher reported mortality p though neither association was statistically significant conclusions societal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public are independently associated with less mortality from covid

Text: patterns of mortality during pandemic an example of spanish flu pandemic of now the attention of the whole world is focused on the developing pandemic of the coronavirus infection covid this article discusses mortality patterns of the deadliest epidemic in the last years the spanish flu pandemic of statistical sources from italy and the usa published shortly after the pandemic were analyzed the analysis was carried out for mortality from all causes since in this case inaccuracies associated with establishing the causes of death are minimized despite the fact that the first cases of the spanish flu appeared in the united states as early as march this first wave of epidemic practically did not affect the total mortality rate the main peak of mortality in occurred in october both in the usa and italy with a gradual decrease in mortality over several months analysis of age specific mortality demonstrates a significant increase in mortality at middle ages years in compared with analysis of mortality trends using the method of latent variables shows a significant increase in the background mortality factor in which turned out to be higher for italy than the mortality losses during the second world war the spanish flu pandemic differs from the current coronavirus pandemic because of significant increase in mortality of middle aged people while the covid pandemic causes a more marked increase in mortality among the elderly with this the covid pandemic is more like the recent flu epidemics than the earlier spanish flu pandemic
