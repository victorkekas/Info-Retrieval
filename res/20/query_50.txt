Text: an evidence based perspective on mrna sars cov vaccine development the first outbreak of coronavirus disease covid caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov occurred in wuhan hubei province china in late the subsequent covid pandemic rapidly affected the health and economy of the world the global approach to the pandemic was to isolate populations to reduce the spread of this deadly virus while vaccines began to be developed in march the first phase i clinical trial of a novel lipid nanoparticle lnp encapsulated mrna based vaccine mrna which encodes the spike protein s protein of sars cov began in the united states us the production of mrna based vaccines is a promising recent development in the production of vaccines however there remain significant challenges in the development and testing of vaccines as rapidly as possible to control covid which requires international collaboration this review aims to describe the background to the rationale for the development of mrna based sars cov vaccines and the current status of the mrna vaccine

Text: a single dose sars cov simulating particle vaccine induces potent neutralizing activities coronavirus disease covid is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov for which a vaccine is urgently needed to control its spreading to facilitate the representation of a native like immunogen without being infectious here we reported a sars cov vaccine candidate designated shacovacc by incorporating spike encoding mrna inside and decorating spike protein on the surface of the virus simulating particles vsps derived from lentiviral particles we characterized the mrna copy number glycosylation status transduction efficiency and innate immune property of the new vaccine platform importantly we showed the shacovacc induced strong spike specific humoral immune responses and potent neutralizing activities by a single injection additionally we disclosed the epitopes of spike specific antibodies using peptide microarray and revealed epitopes susceptible to specific neutralizing antibodies these results support further development of shacovacc as a candidate vaccine for covid and vsp may serve as a new vaccine platform for emerging infectious diseases

Text: preconditioning vaccine sites for mrna transfected dendritic cell therapy and antitumor efficacy messenger rna mrna transfected dendritic cell dc vaccines have been shown to be a powerful modality for eliciting antitumor immune responses in mice and humans however their application has not been fully optimized since many of the factors that contribute to their efficacy remain poorly understood work stemming from our laboratory has recently demonstrated that preconditioning the vaccine site with a recall antigen prior to the administration of a dendritic cell vaccine creates systemic recall responses and resultantly enhances dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes with improved antitumor efficacy this chapter describes the generation of murine mrna transfected dc vaccines as well as a method for vaccine site preconditioning with protein antigen formulations that create potent recall responses

Text: molecular characterization of attenuated vaccine strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that attenuated strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev contain deletions affecting messenger m rnas or in this report we have compared mrnas of four modified live virus vaccines for tgev with the virulent miller pp isolate to determine whether any transcriptional patterns are shared among attenuated strains using northern blot analysis all vaccine viruses expressed mrnas indistinguishable in size from those of miller pp however using s nuclease protection experiments alterations in the regions of the genome from which mrnas and are transcribed were detected in of the vaccine strains when genomic cdna fragments derived from the coding region for mrna were sequenced a nucleotide deletion also found in the attenuated strain purdue was discovered the product of mrna a spike glycoprotein was visualized by western blotting for each vaccine strain and no profound differences in mobility were detected relative to miller pp alterations in the region of the genome from which mrna is transcribed appear to be identical or very similar to sequence alterations already described in this region for purdue one of which is likely to alter the polypeptide product of mrna insertions or deletions in mrnas or may contribute to attenuation but are not a prerequisite for this phenotype the s nuclease protection analysis is a sensitive tool for differentiating particular strains of tgev

Text: lineardesign efficient algorithms for optimized mrna sequence design a messenger rna mrna vaccine has emerged as a promising direction to combat the current covid pandemic this requires an mrna sequence that is stable and highly productive in protein expression features which have been shown to benefit from greater mrna secondary structure folding stability and optimal codon usage however sequence design remains a hard problem due to the exponentially many synonymous mrna sequences that encode the same protein we show that this design problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal language theory and computational linguistics that can be solved in o n time where n is the mrna sequence length this algorithm could still be too slow for large n e g n nucleotides for the spike protein of sars cov so we further developed a linear time approximate version lineardesign inspired by our recent work linearfold this algorithm lineardesign can compute the approximate minimum free energy mrna sequence for this spike protein in just minutes using beam size b with only loss in free energy change compared to exact search i e b infinity which costs hour we also develop two algorithms for incorporating the codon optimality into the design one based on k best parsing to find alternative sequences and one directly incorporating codon optimality into the dynamic programming our work provides efficient computational tools to speed up and improve mrna vaccine development
