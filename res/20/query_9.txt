Text: modeling risk of infectious diseases a case of coronavirus outbreak in four countries background the novel coronavirus ncov outbreak has been a serious concern around the globe since people are in tremor due to the massive spread of coronavirus in the major parts of the world it requires to predict the risk of this infectious disease in this situation we develop a model to measure the risk of infectious disease and predict the risk of ncov transmission by using data of four countries united states australia canada and china methods the model underlies that higher the population density higher the risk of transmission of infectious disease from human to human besides population size case identification rate and travel of infected passengers in different regions are also incorporated in this model results according to the calculated risk index our study identifies new york state in united states us to be the most vulnerable area affected by the novel coronavirus besides other areas province state territory such as hubei china nd massachusetts us rd district of columbia us th new jersey us th quebec canada th australian capital territory australia th are also found as the most risky areas in us china australia and canada conclusion the study suggests avoiding any kind of mass gathering maintaining recommended physical distances and restricting inbound and outbound flights of highly risk prone areas for tackling ncov transmission
