Text: understanding the current status of patients with pulmonary hypertension during covid outbreak a small scale national survey from china pulmonary hypertension is a chronic disease developing progressively with high mortality pulmonary hypertension patients need persistent medical care however limited reports focused on them when there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease in china this national survey was aimed to evaluate the overall condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during this period a questionnaire regarding the living condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during coronavirus disease was designed by pulmonary hypertension diagnostic experts in wuhan asia heart hospital pulmonary hypertension patients and their family members were invited to participate in this survey online one hundred twenty pulmonary hypertension patients and family members participated in the survey n participants came from hubei and others were from other provinces n participants were in home quarantine n were pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease and n patients proclaimed their heart function was well maintained at class i or ii one patient was confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection two patients were hospitalized due to heart function worsening nearly n participants implied shortage in medications during coronavirus disease outbreak a total of n patients indicated that medications were discontinued due to the insufficient supply most of the participants stayed optimistic on either coronavirus disease outbreak or their pulmonary hypertension disease and n patients would go to the hospital for follow up immediately after outbreak these preliminary data show pulmonary hypertension patients are able to avoid severe disease when they are in home quarantine medication supplement is important for pulmonary hypertension patients when their heart function is well maintained in addition there might be increasing requirements of medical care for pulmonary hypertension patients after the outbreak

Text: care of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension during the coronavirus covid pandemic the covid pandemic presents many unique challenges when caring for patients with pulmonary hypertension the covid pandemic has altered routine standard of care practice and the acute management particularly for those patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension where pulmonary arterial hypertension specific treatments are used it is important to balance the ongoing care and evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with exposure risk to covid for patients coming to clinic or the hospital if there is a morbidity and mortality benefit from starting pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies for example in a patient with high likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension then it remains important to complete the thorough evaluation however the covid outbreak may also represent a unique time when pulmonary hypertension experts have to weigh the risks and benefits of the diagnostic work up including potential exposure to covid versus initiating targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in a select high risk high likelihood world symposium pulmonary hypertension group pulmonary arterial hypertension patients this document will highlight some of the issues facing providers patients and the pulmonary arterial hypertension community in real time as the covid pandemic is evolving and is intended to share expected common clinical scenarios and best clinical practices to help the community at large

Text: covid hypertension and cardiovascular diseases should we change the therapy the coronavirus disease covid has spread all around the world in a very short period of time recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases cvd among patients with covid which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these comorbidities to the novel coronavirus as well as the role of hypertension and cvd in progression and the prognosis of covid patients there is a very limited amount of data usually obtained from a small population regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with covid the evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during covid is scarce and the results are conflicting hypertension and cvd after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters primarily age did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in covid patients some investigations speculated about the association between the renin angiotensin aldosterone system raas and susceptibility to covid as well as the relationship between raas inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients withdrawing or switching raas inhibitors would have uncertain benefits but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment which could potentially induce more complications in patients with covid than the infection of coronavirus itself the aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and cvd in patients with covid their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and cvd in covid patients
