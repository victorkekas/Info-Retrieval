Text: characterization of anti viral immunity in recovered individuals infected by sars cov the who has declared sars cov outbreak a public health emergency of international concern however to date there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses especially adaptive immune responses to sars cov infection in this study we collected blood from covid patients who have recently become virus free and therefore were discharged and analyzed their sars cov specific antibody and t cell responses we observed sars cov specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients both were detected in newly discharged patients suggesting both participate in immune mediated protection to viral infection however follow up patients weeks post discharge exhibited high titers of igg antibodies but with low levels of virus specific t cells suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to sars cov and understanding the pathogenesis of covid especially in the severe cases it has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat sars cov infection

Text: human coronavirus reinfection dynamics lessons for sars cov in the current sars cov pandemic a key unsolved question is the quality and duration of acquired immunity in recovered individuals this is crucial to solve however sars cov has circulated for under five months precluding a direct study we therefore monitored subjects over a time span of years providing a total of follow up person months and determined a their antibody levels following infection by any of the four seasonal human coronaviruses and b the time period after which reinfections by the same virus can occur an alarmingly short duration of protective immunity to coronaviruses was found by both analyses we saw frequent reinfections at months post infection and a substantial reduction in antibody levels as soon as months post infection

Text: the end of social confinement and covid re emergence risk the lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions for sars cov raises the possibility of covid recurrence we explore different post confinement scenarios by using a stochastic modified seir susceptible exposed infectious recovered model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period and also incorporates time decaying effects due to potential loss of acquired immunity people s increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of non pharmaceutical interventions our results suggest that lockdowns should remain in place for at least days to prevent epidemic growth as well as a potentially larger second wave of sars cov cases occurring within months the best case scenario should also gradually incorporate workers in a daily proportion at most higher than during the confinement period we show that decaying immunity and particularly awareness and behaviour have significant effects on both the current wave of infection and on preventing covid re emergence social distancing and individual non pharmaceutical interventions could potentially remove the need for lockdowns

Text: immunity to prrsv double edged sword abstract the immune system is a double edged sword for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv infection on one edge prrsv has a predilection for immune cells and the disease manifestations can be linked directly to changes in the immune system prrsv appears to replicate extensively if not exclusively in cells of the immune lineage notably macrophages the direct replication of which may lead to immunosuppression precipitate secondary infection and or mediate disease on the other edge the virus stimulates immunity post infection that protects an animal from re infection a vast array of structural and functionally distinct antibody specific to prrsv are generated following infection or vaccination discrete populations of functional antibodies appear at different times and possibly reflect reactivity to different prrsv polypeptides cell mediated immune responses specific to prrsv can be detected in various exposed pigs as well thus the immune system appears to be intimately involved in both the disease process and protection from disease it is unclear at this state of understanding what immune compartment provides protective immunity is it humoral i e antibodies selective functionally distinct populations of antibodies specific for selected prrsv polypeptides or is cellular immunity essential for protection or both this review will attempt to summarize the current state of knowledge of the complex interaction of the immune system and prrsv

Text: egyptian rousette bats maintain long term protective immunity against marburg virus infection despite diminished antibody levels although bats are natural reservoir hosts for numerous zoonotic viruses little is known about the long term dynamics of the host immune response following infection and how these viruses are maintained in nature the egyptian rousette bat erb is a known reservoir host for marburg virus marv following infection of erbs with marv virus specific igg antibodies are induced but rapidly wane and by months post infection the bats are seronegative to determine whether reinfection of erbs plays a role in marv maintenance we challenge groups of erbs that were naturally or experimentally infected with marv months prior no bats in either group exhibit evidence of marv replication or shedding and all bats develop virus specific secondary immune responses this study demonstrates that infection of erbs with marv induces long term protective immunity against reinfection and indicates that other factors such as host population dynamics drive marv maintenance in nature

Text: immunity after covid protection or sensitization motivated by historical and present clinical observations we discuss the possible unfavorable evolution of the immunity similar to documented antibody dependent enhancement scenarios after a first infection with covid more precisely we ask the question of how the epidemic outcomes are affected if the initial infection does not provide immunity but rather sensitization to future challenges we first provide background comparison with the sars epidemic then we use a compartmental epidemic model structured by immunity level taken here as age classes that we fit on available data this allows to derive quantitative insights into the future number of severe cases and deaths
