Text: heart injury signs are associated with higher and earlier mortality in coronavirus disease covid importance heart injury can be easily induced by viral infection such as adenovirus and enterovirus however whether coronavirus disease covid causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated objective to explore whether heart injury occurs in covid on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later design setting and participants a single center retrospective cohort study including covid patients admitted from december to january in wuhan jinyintan hospital china follow up was completed on february exposures high levels of heart injury indicators on admission hs tni ck ck mb ldh α hbdh main outcomes and measures mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality survival days results of patients with covid the mean age was years standard deviation range years and were male increased hs tni levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity especially hypertension high hs tni on admission pg ml even within the clinical normal range pg ml already can be associated with higher mortality high hs tni was associated with increased inflammatory levels neutrophils il crp and pct and decreased immune levels lymphocytes monocytes and cd and cd t cells ck was not associated with mortality increased ck mb levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking high ck mb on admission was associated with higher mortality high ck mb was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes increased ldh and α hbdh levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension both high ldh and α hbdh on admission were associated with higher mortality both high ldh and α hbdh were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels hs tni level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days r ci p ldh level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days r ci p conclusions and relevance heart injury signs arise in covid especially in older patients patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking covid virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm high levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days covid patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists because covid is never just confined to respiratory injury

Text: the stirling protocol putting the environment at the heart of prosperity and social inclusion abstract while the global coronavirus crisis impacts society and the economy in a myriad of ways it provides what is likely to be a once in a lifetime opportunity for us to rethink our response to climate change according to the global risk register extreme weather and climate action failure are the two most likely and impactful risks to the global economy which now more than ever needs to be avoided addressing the major challenges that we face from climate change can often appear to conflict with economic priorities add to this the fact that environmental mitigation steps can inadvertently exclude sections of the population and the enormity and complexity of climate change responses can result in paralysis in contrast the stirling protocol provides the framework for rapid effective action and comprises three pillars environment economy inclusion by addressing and balancing these three pillars the simple protocol can be adopted throughout organisations putting the environment at the heart of sustainable prosperity and inclusion and provide a benchmark for positive action

Text: obesity cardiovascular disease and influenza how are they connected purpose of review to better understand the impact of obesity and cardiovascular diseases on influenza a infection recent findings this infection could have detrimental outcomes in obese patients with cardiovascular diseases such as an increased risk length of hospitalization disease severity morbidity and mortality nevertheless there also might be some cardioprotective benefits associated with influenza vaccination such as a reduced mortality hospitalization and acute coronary syndromes in patients with coronary heart disease and or heart failure summary obesity negatively impacts immune function and host defense recent studies report obesity to be an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality following infection obese patients might need special considerations in the treatment however there is not enough evidence to fully comprehend the mechanisms behind the reduced immunocompetence when influenza a infection occurs future studies should focus on special consideration treatments when the patients have not been vaccinated and have cardiovascular diseases

Text: a close up on covid and cardiovascular diseases abstract aims to analyze the potential mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunctions induced by coronavirus disease covid and to evaluate more effective therapeutic pathways for patients with cardiovascular diseases data synthesis covid mainly invades the lungs causing its serious damage studies found that covid induced the renin angiotensin system imbalance inflammatory storm hypoxemia and stress response et al all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis even increasing mortality in covid patients conclusions in the process of management of covid infections close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases early identification timely and effective treatments maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long term prognosis the pandemic of covid has been taking lives worldwide it caused by a novel coronavirus which human being are lack of defensive function in whole population it targets human s lung and causes serious damage of lungs based on early reports for people with underlying heart issues the concerns are serious it appears people over with coronary heart diseases or hypertension is more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms in addition some of hospitalized covid patients had cardiovascular diseases in china as characteristic analysis of covid patients hypertension and severe myocardial damage contribute to severity and mortality of covid patients therefore to better understand the development of covid and the impacts of cardiovascular diseases will add valuable measures to the management of covid patients

Text: an experimental model for myocarditis and congestive heart failure after rabbit coronavirus infection in a model for virus induced myocarditis and congestive heart failure rabbit coronavirus infection was divided into acute days and subacute days phases on the basis of day of death and pathologic findings during the acute phase the principal histologic lesions were degeneration and necrosis of myocytes myocytolysis interstitial edema and hemorrhage the severity of these changes increased in the subacute phase pleural effusion and congestion of the lungs and liver were also present at this time myocarditis was detected by day and peaked by day heart weights and heart weight to body weight ratios were increased and dilation of the right ventricular cavity became prominent early in infection and persisted in contrast dilation of the left ventricle occurred late in the subacute stage virus was isolated from infected hearts between days and these data suggest that rabbit coronavirus infection progresses to myocarditis and congestive heart failure
