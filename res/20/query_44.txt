Text: brief research report bidirectional impact of imperfect mask use on reproduction number of covid a next generation matrix approach the use of masks as a means of reducing transmission of covid outside healthcare settings has proved controversial masks are thought to have two modes of effect they prevent infection with covid in wearers and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infection we used a simple next generation matrix approach to estimate the conditions under which masks would reduce the reproduction number of covid under a threshold of our model takes into account the possibility of assortative mixing where mask users interact preferentially with other mask users we make key observations masks even with suboptimal efficacy in both prevention of acquisition and transmission of infection could substantially decrease the reproduction number for covid if widely used widespread masking may be sufficient to suppress epidemics where r has been brought close to via other measures e g distancing assortment within populations the tendency for interactions between masked individuals to be more likely than interactions between masked and unmasked individuals would rapidly erode the impact of masks as such mask uptake needs to be fairly universal to have an effect this simple model suggests that widespread uptake of masking could be determinative in suppressing covid epidemics in regions with r t at or near

Text: professional and home made face masks reduce exposure to respiratory infections among the general population background governments are preparing for a potential influenza pandemic therefore they need data to assess the possible impact of interventions face masks worn by the general population could be an accessible and affordable intervention if effective when worn under routine circumstances methodology we assessed transmission reduction potential provided by personal respirators surgical masks and home made masks when worn during a variety of activities by healthy volunteers and a simulated patient principal findings all types of masks reduced aerosol exposure relatively stable over time unaffected by duration of wear or type of activity but with a high degree of individual variation personal respirators were more efficient than surgical masks which were more efficient than home made masks regardless of mask type children were less well protected outward protection mask wearing by a mechanical head was less effective than inward protection mask wearing by healthy volunteers conclusions significance any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence personal respirators providing most protection masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection against aerosol transmission

Text: event specific interventions to minimize covid transmission coronavirus disease covid is a global pandemic with over million cases worldwide currently there is no treatment and no vaccine interventions such as hand washing masks social distancing and social bubbles are used to limit community transmission but it is challenging to choose the best interventions for a given activity here we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings we introduce the concept of event r the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infected individual at an event we obtain a fundamental relationship between event r and four parameters transmission intensity duration of exposure the proximity of individuals and the degree of mixing we use reports of small outbreaks to establish event r and transmission intensity in a range of settings we identify principles that guide whether physical distancing masks and other barriers to transmission or social bubbles will be most effective we outline how this information can be obtained and used to re open economies with principled measures to reduce covid transmission

Text: the effect of mask use on the spread of influenza during a pandemic face masks have traditionally been used in general infection control but their efficacy at the population level in preventing transmission of influenza viruses has not been studied in detail data from published clinical studies indicate that the infectivity of influenza a virus is probably very high so that transmission of infection may involve low doses of virus at low doses the relation between dose and the probability of infection is approximately linear so that the reduction in infection risk is proportional to the reduction in exposure due to particle retention of the mask a population transmission model was set up to explore the impact of population wide mask use allowing estimation of the effects of mask efficacy and coverage fraction of the population wearing masks on the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate we conclude that population wide use of face masks could make an important contribution in delaying an influenza pandemic mask use also reduces the reproduction number possibly even to levels sufficient for containing an influenza outbreak

Text: understanding the impact of face mask usage through epidemic simulation of large social networks evidence from the sars epidemic and h n pandemic shows that face masks can be an effective non pharmaceutical intervention in minimizing the spread of airborne viruses recent studies have shown that using face masks is correlated to an individual s age and gender where females and older adults are more likely to wear a mask than males or youths there are only a few studies quantifying the impact of using face masks to slow the spread of an epidemic at the population level and even fewer studies that model their impact in a population where the use of face masks depends upon the age and gender of the population we use a state of the art agent based simulation to model the use of face masks and quantify their impact on three levels of an influenza epidemic and compare different mitigation scenarios these scenarios involve changing the demographics of mask usage the adoption of mask usage in relation to a perceived threat level and the combination of masks with other non pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing and social distancing our results shows that face masks alone have limited impact on the spread of influenza however when face masks are combined with other interventions such as hand sanitizer they can be more effective we also observe that monitoring social internet systems can be a useful technique to measure compliance we conclude that educating the public on the effectiveness of masks to increase compliance can reduce morbidity and mortality

Text: impact of non pharmaceutical interventions on uris and influenza in crowded urban households objectives we compared the impact of three household interventions education education with alcohol based hand sanitizer and education with hand sanitizer and face masks on incidence and secondary transmission of upper respiratory infections uris and influenza knowledge of transmission of uris and vaccination rates methods a total of primarily hispanic households participated participants reported symptoms twice weekly and nasal swabs were collected from those with an influenza like illness ili households were followed for up to months and home visits were made at least every two months results we recorded uris of which cases reported ilis and were laboratory confirmed cases of influenza demographic factors significantly associated with infection rates included age gender birth location education and employment the hand sanitizer group was significantly more likely to report that no household member had symptoms p or of members receiving influenza vaccine increased during the study p despite the fact that compliance with mask wearing was poor mask wearing as well as increased crowding lower education levels of caretakers and index cases years of age compared with adults were associated with significantly lower secondary transmission rates all p conclusions in this population there was no detectable additional benefit of hand sanitizer or face masks over targeted education on overall rates of uris but mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations during the study period community concern about methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus was occurring perhaps contributing to the use of hand sanitizer in the education control group and diluting the intervention s measurable impact

Text: causal impact of masks policies behavior on early covid pandemic in the u s this paper evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies such as school business and restaurant closures adopted by the us states on the growth rates of confirmed covid cases and social distancing behavior measured by google mobility reports where we take into consideration of people s voluntarily behavioral response to new information of transmission risks using the us state level data our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of people s social distancing behavior and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior our counterfactual experiments indicate that removing all policies on april st of would have lead to to times more additional cases by late may removing only the non essential businesses closures while maintaining restrictions on movie theaters and restaurants would have increased the weekly growth rate of cases between and and would have lead to to more cases by late may finally nationally mandating face masks for employees on april st would have reduced the case growth rate by this leads to to fewer reported cases by late may which translates into roughly thousand saved lives
