Text: the covid pandemic s impact on u s electricity demand and supply an early view from the data after the onset of the recent covid pandemic a number of studies reported on possible changes in electricity consumption trends the overall theme of these reports was that electricity use has decreased during the pandemic but the power grid is still reliable mostly due to reduced economic activity in this paper we analyze electricity data upto end of may examining both electricity demand and variables that can indicate stress on the power grid such as peak demand and demand ramp rate we limit this study to three states in the usa new york california and florida the results indicate that the effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is not a simple reduction from comparable time frames and there are noticeable differences among regions the variables that can indicate stress on the grid also conveyed mixed messages some indicate an increase in stress some indicate a decrease and some do not indicate any clear difference a positive message is that some of the changes that were observed around the time stay at home orders were issued appeared to revert back by may a key challenge in ascribing any observed change to the pandemic is correcting for weather we provide a weather correction method apply it to a small city wide area and discuss the implications of the estimated changes in demand the weather correction exercise underscored that weather correction is as challenging as it is important

Text: susceptible supply limits the role of climate in the early sars cov pandemic preliminary evidence suggests that climate may modulate the transmission of sars cov yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pandemic trajectory given high susceptibility is a core driver here we use a climate dependent epidemic model to simulate the sars cov pandemic probing different scenarios based on known coronavirus biology we find that while variations in weather may be important for endemic infections during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen the climate drives only modest changes to pandemic size a preliminary analysis of non pharmaceutical control measures indicates that they may moderate the pandemic climate interaction via susceptible depletion our findings suggest without effective control measures strong outbreaks are likely in more humid climates and summer weather will not substantially limit pandemic growth

Text: the weather impacts the outbreak of covid in mainland china recent literature has suggested that climate conditions have considerably significant influences on the transmission of coronavirus covid however there is a lack of comprehensive study that investigates the relationships between multiple weather factors and the development of covid pandemic while excluding the impact of social factors in this paper we study the relationships between six main weather factors and the infection statistics of covid on cities in mainland china our correlation analysis using weather and infection statistics indicates that all the studied weather factors are correlated with the spread of covid where precipitation shows the strongest correlation we also build a weather aware predictive model that forecasts the number of infected cases should there be a second wave of the outbreak in mainland china our predicted results show that cities located in different geographical areas are likely to be challenged with the second wave of covid at very different time periods and the severity of the outbreak varies to a large degree in correspondence with the varying weather conditions

Text: weather conditions and covid transmission estimates and projections background understanding and projecting the spread of covid requires reliable estimates of how weather components are associated with the transmission of the virus prior research on this topic has been inconclusive identifying key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impact on transmission we study this question using one of the largest assembled databases of covid infections and weather methods we assemble a dataset that includes virus transmission and weather data across locations from december to april using simulation we identify key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impacts on transmission design a statistical method to overcome these challenges and validate it in a blinded simulation study using this method and controlling for location specific response trends we estimate how different weather variables are associated with the reproduction number for covid we then use the estimates to project the relative weather related risk of covid transmission across the world and in large cities results we show that the delay between exposure and detection of infection complicates the estimation of weather impact on covid transmission potentially explaining significant variability in results to date correcting for that distributed delay and offering conservative estimates we find a negative relationship between temperatures above degrees celsius and estimated reproduction number r with each degree celsius associated with a ci to reduction in r higher levels of relative humidity strengthen the negative effect of temperature above degrees moreover one millibar of additional pressure increases r by approximately percent ci to at the median pressure millibars in our sample we also find significant positive effects for wind speed precipitation and diurnal temperature on r sensitivity analysis and simulations show that results are robust to multiple assumptions despite conservative estimates weather effects are associated with a change in r between the th and th percentile of weather conditions in our sample conclusions these results provide evidence for the relationship between several weather variables and the spread of covid however the conservatively estimated relationships are not strong enough to seasonally control the epidemic in most locations

Text: effects of school closure on incidence of pandemic influenza in alberta canada background control of pandemic influenza by social distancing measures such as school closures is a controversial aspect of pandemic planning however investigations of the extent to which these measures actually affect the progression of a pandemic have been limited objective to examine correlations between the incidence of pandemic h n ph n influenza in alberta canada in and school closures or weather changes and to estimate the effects of school closures and weather changes on ph n transmission design mathematical transmission models were fit to data that compared the pattern of confirmed ph n cases with the school calendar and weather patterns setting alberta canada from april to january data sources virologic test results census data daily temperature and humidity data and school calendars measurements age specific daily counts of positive results for ph n from the complete database of specimens submitted to the alberta provincial laboratory for public health for virologic testing from april to january results the ending and restarting of school terms had a major effect in attenuating the first wave and starting the second wave of pandemic influenza cases mathematical models suggested that school closure reduced transmission among school age children by more than and that this was a key factor in interrupting transmission the models also indicated that seasonal changes in weather had a significant effect on the temporal pattern of the epidemic limitations data probably represent a small sample of all viral infections the mathematical models make simplifying assumptions in order to make simulations and analysis feasible conclusion analysis of data from unrestricted virologic testing during an influenza pandemic provides compelling evidence that closing schools can have dramatic effects on transmission of pandemic influenza school closure seems to be an effective strategy for slowing the spread of pandemic influenza in countries with social contact networks similar to those in canada primary funding source canadian institutes of health research natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and public health agency of canada
