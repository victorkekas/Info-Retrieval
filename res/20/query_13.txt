Text: understanding coronavirus since the identification of the first cases of the coronavirus in december in wuhan china there has been a significant amount of confusion regarding the origin and spread of the so called coronavirus officially named sars cov and the cause of the disease covid conflicting messages from the media and officials across different countries and organizations the abundance of disparate sources of information unfounded conspiracy theories on the origins of the newly emerging virus and the inconsistent public health measures across different countries have all served to increase the level of anxiety in the population where did the virus come from how is it transmitted how does it cause disease is it like flu what is a pandemic what can we do to stop its spread written by a leading expert this concise and accessible introduction provides answers to the most common questions surrounding coronavirus for a general audience

Text: understanding the covid outbreak a comparative data analytics and study the coronavirus also known as the covid virus has emerged in wuhan china since late november since that time it has been spreading at large scale until today all around the world it is currently recognized as the world s most viral and severe epidemic spread in the last twenty years as compared to ebola mers and sars despite being still in the middle of the outbreak there is an urgent need to understand the impact of covid the objective is to clarify how it was spread so fast in a short time worldwide in unprecedented fashion this paper represents a first initiative to achieve this goal and it provides a comprehensive analytical study about the coronavirus the contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and predictive models that give insights into covid impact through the analysis of extensive data updated daily for the outbreak in all countries we aim at answering several open questions how does covid spread around the world what is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent region and country levels how does its severity compare with other epidemic outbreaks including ebola mers and sars is there a correlation between the number of confirmed cases and death cases we present a comprehensive analytics visualization to address the questions mentioned above to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic analytical papers that pave the way towards a better understanding of covid the analytical dashboards and collected data of this study are available online

Text: a new transmission route for the propagation of the sars cov coronavirus we explore here how variation in the sars cov virus tropism could influence epidemic spread we use a compartmental model fit to the existing data the model indicates that wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms gut tropism and a second propagation route through environment was present for singapore and shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet adequate prevention measures taking into account both routes should be implemented

Text: the covid pandemic and plastic surgery literature review ethical analysis and proposed guidelines background covid known as the coronavirus has spread to over countries in response many organizations have spoken out and called to cancel all elective surgical procedures objective our study aimed to provide clear recommendations for plastic surgeons to follow by addressing the following issues what defines elective surgery and where does one draw the line between essential versus nonessential services how does this differ in the hospital versus private practice setting if called upon to operate on a patient with covid how do plastic surgeons protect themselves while still providing excellent medical care methods a prisma systematic review of the literature on plastic surgery in the setting of a pandemic was performed on march an ethical analysis was conducted using the four principles of medical ethics results the initial search yielded articles eighteen articles were relevant and included for analysis only one editorial article was published in a plastic surgery journal accordingly no peer reviewed published covid guidelines exist for plastic surgery given that this pandemic may place healthcare systems under undue stress with an unpredictable trajectory it is the responsibility of the plastic surgeon to assess and postpone cases whenever possible to properly contribute to adequate resource allocation and patient safety measures conclusion this article fills an important gap in the literature by addressing covid and providing guidelines for upholding ethics and responsible resource allocation by upholding these standards plastic surgeons can do their part to help minimize the spread of this virus

Text: dissemination of mhv strain jhm infection does not require specific coronavirus receptors in this report we demonstrate the syncytial spread of mhv strain jhm infection through non murine cell cultures which lack a specific mhv receptor and are therefore resistant to infection by free virions this was achieved by allowing infected murine cells to settle onto confluent monolayers of non murine cells in a straightforward infectious center assay receptor independent syncytium formation induced by cells expressing the mhv spike s from recombinant vaccinia viruses vv indicated that spread was mediated by this coronavirus glycoprotein we conclude that the s protein of mhv is so potently fusogenic that it does not require prior binding to a virus specific surface receptor to induce fusion of closely opposed plasma membranes

Text: optimized lockdown strategies for curbing the spread of covid a south african case study to curb the spread of covid many governments around the world have implemented tiered lockdowns with varying degrees of stringency lockdown levels are typically increased when the disease spreads and reduced when the disease abates a predictive control approach is used to develop optimized lockdown strategies for curbing the spread of covid these strategies are then applied to south african data the south african case is of immediate interest as the number of confirmed infectious cases does not appear to have peaked yet at the time of writing while at the same time the south african government is busy reducing the degree of lockdown an epidemiological model for the spread of covid in south africa was previously developed and is used in conjunction with a hybrid model predictive controller to optimize lockdown management under different policy scenarios scenarios considered include how flatten the curve to a level that the healthcare system can cope with how to balance lives and livelihoods and what impact the compliance of the population to the lockdown measures has on the spread of covid

Text: covid learning from lessons to guide treatment and prevention interventions coronavirus disease covid is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and first emerged in december in wuhan hubei province china since then the virus has rapidly spread to many countries while the outbreak in china appears to be in decline the disease has spread across the world with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection related deaths here we highlight i the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of covid disease and ii an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent covid and potential future related pandemics although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza the rate does seem to vary from country to country possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients however no proven effective therapies for sars cov currently exist a number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of covid patients but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs either alone or in combination will prove effective there is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against covid but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available this review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the covid pandemic examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of covid and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine
