Text: the journey of remdesivir from ebola to covid countries around the world are currently fighting the coronavirus disease covid pandemic which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov sars cov is a betacoronavirus belonging to the same genus as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov currently there are no proven antiviral therapies for covid numerous clinical trials have been initiated to identify an effective treatment one leading candidate is remdesivir gs a broad spectrum antiviral that was initially developed for the treatment of ebola virus ebov although remdesivir performed well in preclinical studies it did not meet efficacy endpoints in a randomized trial conducted during an ebola outbreak remdesivir holds promise for treating covid based on in vitro activity against sars cov uncontrolled clinical reports and limited data from randomized trials overall current data are insufficient to judge the efficacy of remdesivir for covid and the results of additional randomized studies are eagerly anticipated in this narrative review we provide an overview of ebola and coronavirus outbreaks we then summarize preclinical and clinical studies of remdesivir for ebola and covid

Text: structural basis of the potential binding mechanism of remdesivir to sars cov rna dependent rna polymerase image see text starting from late the coronavirus disease covid has emerged as a once in a century pandemic with deadly consequences which urgently calls for new treatments cures and supporting apparatuses recently because of its positive results in clinical trials remdesivir was approved by the food and drug administration to treat covid through emergency use authorization here we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target sars cov virus rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp we first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of sars cov nsp rdrp with a sequence identity of we then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir rdrp complex to the atp bound poliovirus rdrp without the rna template the putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations the resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the rna template when aligned with the newly solved cryo em structure of sars cov rdrp the relative binding free energy between remdesivir and atp was calculated to be kcal mol where remdesivir bound much stronger to sars cov rdrp than the natural substrate atp the fold improvement in the k d from remdesivir over atp indicates an effective replacement of atp in blocking of the rdrp preinsertion site key residues d s and r are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir these findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a sars cov rna chain terminator effectively stopping its rna replication with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and or drug resistance studies
