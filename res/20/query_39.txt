Text: cytokine storm in covid patients transforms to a cytokine super cyclone in patients with risk factors the seventh human coronavirus sars cov belongs to the cluster of extremely pathogenic coronaviruses like sars cov and mers cov which are established to cause lower respiratory tract infection the viral infection can be fatal as the disease advances to pneumonia followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards increasingly higher cytokine concentration on account of over stimulated immune response against the virus or the cytokine storm is the reason behind the manifestation of lethal clinical symptoms in this article we discuss the immune pathogenesis of cytokine storm and its relation with sars cov covid risk factors people with underlying risk factors are more susceptible to fatal complications of covid infection leading to poor clinical outcome the increased pro inflammatory immune status in patients with risk factors diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease copd exacerbates the cytokine storm of covid to a cytokine super cyclone we also overviewed antiviral immune response provided by bcg vaccine involving the il β il and tnf α secretion via trained monocytes which confers early protection against sars cov
