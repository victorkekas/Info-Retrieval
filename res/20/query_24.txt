Text: diabetes management and specific considerations for patients with diabetes during coronavirus diseases pandemic a scoping review background and aims the global pandemic of coronavirus covid affects almost all countries in the world which potentially alter diabetes management many diabetes patients are experiencing barrier of care due to the policy related to covid this article aims to review the current evidence on diabetes management and specific consideration during the covid pandemic for people living with diabetes methods we conducted a scoping review in pubmed science direct doaj and microsoft academics databases from january to april searching terms included covid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and diabetes mellitus were used only scientific articles discussing diabetes management and specific considerations were selected and extracted results a total of articles was selected in the analysis most were published in diabetes journals all articles discussed diabetes management and of them provided diabetes care in specific considerations we discussed issue of diabetes management in glycemic control and monitoring dietary intake physical activity medication education and prevention of covid infection that applicable for diabetes patients in addition specific considerations explored caring for diabetes in children and adolescents pregnancy elderly emergency or critical care to offer certain concern for raising the awareness conclusions this review specifies a summary of diabetes management as well as the particular considerations to care people living with diabetes during covid pandemic patients health care providers and policy makers could take advantage of the review to assist diabetic people passing through covid pandemic session with optimum glycemic outcome

Text: coronavirus disease and diabetes the epidemic and the korean diabetes association perspective diabetes has been associated with more severe outcomes and higher mortality in coronavirus disease covid patients compare to morbidity and mortality in patients without diabetes several mechanisms may play a role in this greater morbidity and mortality especially uncontrolled hyperglycemia an impaired immune system pre existing proinflammatory states multiple comorbidities and dysregulated angiotensin converting enzyme signaling thus the diabetes medical community emergently needs to know about covid and its effects on patients with diabetes as they must take precautions to carefully manage these patients during the covid pandemic the korean diabetes association provides some guidance and practical recommendations for the management of diabetes during the pandemic this report provides insight into the association between diabetes and covid proper management of diabetes in patients with covid and an official suggestion by the korean diabetes association for managing the covid outbreak

Text: diabetes and novel coronavirus infection implications for treatment the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov outbreak originating in december has resulted in a worldwide pandemic affecting millions across almost countries people with diabetes appear to develop more severe forms of the disease and to require intensive care unit support and or mechanical ventilation more frequently than those with other underlying medical conditions the mortality rate among people with diabetes is also significantly higher than that among people without diabetes a diagnosis of diabetes is often an indicator of poor underlying metabolic health and frequently people with diabetes have multiple risk factors for severe coronavirus disease covid including cardiovascular and renal disease in this review we discuss the potential biological mechanisms by which sars cov may interact with disease processes implicated in diabetes and discuss how treatments commonly used for people with diabetes may affect covid severity and progression there is currently a lack of evidence from human studies and further trials in this area will prove useful to further expand our understanding of this rapidly developing disease process to improve outcomes for this high risk group of patients electronic supplementary material the online version of this article s contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users

Text: influence of diabetes mellitus on the severity and fatality of sars cov covid infection aim to evaluate the influence of diabetes on the severity and fatality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov infection materials and methods the medical records of hospitalized coronavirus disease covid patients were collected and classified into non severe mild moderate cases and severe severe critical cases groups logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of severe covid severe critical infection in addition a meta analysis including published studies reported the impact of diabetes on the severity and fatality of covid the current study was conducted using fixed effects models results there were diabetes and non diabetes cases among the hospitalized covid patients seven patients with diabetes were diagnosed as severe covid cases which was significantly higher than that in the non diabetes group p after adjustment for age and gender diabetes was significantly associated with covid severity or ci a meta analysis further confirmed the positive association between diabetes and covid severity pooled or ci moreover the patients with diabetes infected with sars cov had a fold higher risk of fatality compared with those patients without diabetes ci conclusions our findings provide new evidence that diabetes is associated with a higher risk of severity and fatality of covid therefore intensive monitoring and antidiabetic therapy should be considered in patients with diabetes with sars cov infection
