Text: the unexpected risks of covid on asthma control in children abstract much is being learned about clinical outcomes for adult covid patients with underlying chronic conditions however there is less coverage on how the covid pandemic impacts the management of chronic medical conditions in children and youth such as asthma asthma is a common chronic medical condition in children that is uniquely susceptible to changes brought upon by covid sudden dramatic changes in the environment medical practice and medication use have altered the asthma management landscape with potential impacts on asthma outcomes in this paper we review how changes in transportation and travel patterns school attendance physical activity and time spent indoors along with changes in healthcare delivery since the start of the pandemic all play a contributing role in asthma control in children we review potentially important influences of asthma control in children during the covid pandemic worthy of further study

Text: reduced inflammatory responses to sars cov infection in children presenting to hospital with covid in china background infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in children is associated with better outcomes than in adults the inflammatory response to covid infection in children remains poorly characterised methods we retrospectively analysed the medical records of laboratory confirmed covid patients aged month to years from wuhan and jingzhou of hubei province patients presented between january th and march th information on clinical features laboratory results plasma cytokines chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed findings children admitted to hospital with covid were more likely to be male and the median age was iqr years all but one patient with severe disease was aged under and the majority had significant co morbidities despite having viral pneumonia on ct scanning only patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin il il il tumour necrosis factor tnf alpha and interferon ifn gamma between patients with mild moderate or severe disease interpretations we demonstrated that the immune responses of children to covid infection is significantly different from that seen in adults our evidence suggests that sars cov does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or cytokine storm in children with covid and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease these data also imply anti cytokine therapies may not be effective in children with moderate covid

Text: sars cov covid what do we know about children a systematic review background few paediatric cases of covid have been reported and we know little about the epidemiology in children though more is known about other coronaviruses we aimed to understand the infection rate clinical presentation clinical outcomes and transmission dynamics for sars cov in order to inform clinical and public health measures methods we undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to sars cov in paediatric populations the search terms also included sars cov and mers cov we searched three databases and the covid resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers english abstracts of chinese language papers were included data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted results studies relating to covid were included in the review children appear to be less affected by covid than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children though radiological abnormalities are noted severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission conclusions children appear to have a low observed case rate of covid but may have similar rates to adults of infection with sars cov this discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention be tested and counted in observed cases of covid

Text: neurotropic mechanisms in covid and their potential influence on neuropsychological outcomes in children children have shown more physical resilience to covid than adults but there is a cohort of vulnerable infants and young children who may experience disease burden both in the acute phase and chronically children may have had early undocumented exposure to covid even when the risk of exposure was known developmental variables may have made the avoidance of physical proximity difficult for children preliminary hypotheses concerning neurotropic factors have been documented by researchers children with covid and comorbid physical or mental disorders may be vulnerable to exacerbations of neurotropic factors and comorbidities the neural impact of which has been documented for other coronaviruses researchers are investigating covid symptom descriptions neurotropic mechanisms at the genomic and transcriptomatic levels neurological manifestations and the impact of comorbid health complications neuropsychologists need information concerning the likely impact of covid on children with a view toward that goal this article provides recommendations for some initial updates in neuropsychology practice
