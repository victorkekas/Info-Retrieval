Text: modelling the potential impact of social distancing on the covid epidemic in south africa the novel coronavirus covid pandemic continues to be a global health problem whose impact has been significantly felt in south africa social distancing has been touted as the best form of response in managing a rapid increase in the number of infected cases in this paper we present a deterministic model to model the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of covid in south africa the model is fitted to the currently available data on the cumulative number of infected cases and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing are presented the results show a continued rise in the number of cases in the lock down period with the current levels of social distancing albeit at a lower rate the model shows that the number of cases will rise to above cases by the end of the lockdown the model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lock down measures a relaxation of the social distancing by can result in a rise in the number of cumulative cases while on the other hand increasing the levels of social distancing by would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about these results have implications on the management and policy direction in the early phases of the epidemic

Text: age structured impact of social distancing on the covid epidemic in india the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid has been declared a pandemic by the who the structures of social contact critically determine the spread of the infection and in the absence of vaccines the control of these structures through large scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective means of mitigation here we use an age structured sir model with social contact matrices obtained from surveys and bayesian imputation to study the progress of the covid epidemic in india the basic reproductive ratio r and its time dependent generalization are computed based on case data age distribution and social contact structure the impact of social distancing measures workplace non attendance school closure lockdown and their efficacy with durations are then investigated a three week lockdown is found insufficient to prevent a resurgence and instead protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested forecasts are provided for the reduction in age structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these measures our study underlines the importance of age and social contact structures in assessing the country specific impact of mitigatory social distancing

Text: impact of social distancing during covid pandemic on crime in los angeles and indianapolis governments have implemented social distancing measures to address the ongoing covid pandemic the measures include instructions that individuals maintain social distance when in public school closures limitations on gatherings and business operations and instructions to remain at home social distancing may have an impact on the volume and distribution of crime crimes such as residential burglary may decrease as a byproduct of increased guardianship over personal space and property crimes such as domestic violence may increase because of extended periods of contact between potential offenders and victims understanding the impact of social distancing on crime is critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to deal with the evolving crisis understanding how social distancing policies impact crime may also provide insights into whether people are complying with public health measures examination of the most recently available data from both los angeles ca and indianapolis in shows that social distancing has had a statistically significant impact on a few specific crime types however the overall effect is notably less than might be expected given the scale of the disruption to social and economic life

Text: impact of timing of and adherence to social distancing measures on covid burden in the us a simulation modeling approach background across the u s various social distancing measures were implemented to control covid pandemic however there is uncertainty in the effectiveness of such measures for specific regions with varying population demographics and different levels of adherence to social distancing the objective of this paper is to determine the impact of social distancing measures in unique regions methods we developed covid agent based simulation model covam an agent based simulation model abm that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering population demographics limited testing availability imported infections from outside of the region asymptomatic disease transmission and adherence to social distancing measures we adopted covam to represent covid associated events in dane county wisconsin milwaukee metropolitan area and new york city nyc we used covam to evaluate the impact of three different aspects of social distancing adherence to social distancing measures timing of implementing social distancing and timing of easing social distancing results we found that the timing of social distancing and adherence level had a major effect on covid occurrence for example in nyc implementing social distancing measures on march instead of march would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from to as of may whereas a week delay in implementing such measures could have increased the number of confirmed cases to easing social distancing measures on june instead of june in nyc would increase the total number of confirmed cases from to as of july conclusion the timing of implementing social distancing measures adherence to the measures and timing of their easing have major effects on the number of covid cases primary funding source national institute of allergy and infectious diseases institute

Text: modeling covid mortality in the us community context and mobility matter the united states has become an epicenter for the coronavirus disease covid pandemic however communities have been unequally affected and evidence is growing that social determinants of health may be exacerbating the pandemic furthermore the impact and timing of social distancing at the community level have yet to be fully explored we investigated the relative associations between covid mortality and social distancing sociodemographic makeup economic vulnerabilities and comorbidities in counties surrounding major metropolitan areas in the us using a flexible and robust time series modeling approach we found that counties with poorer health and less wealth were associated with higher daily mortality rates compared to counties with fewer economic vulnerabilities and fewer pre existing health conditions declines in mobility were associated with up to lower mortality rates relative to pre social distancing levels of mobility but effects were lagged between days while we cannot estimate causal impact this study provides insight into the association of social distancing on community mortality while accounting for key community factors for full transparency and reproducibility we provide all data and code used in this study

Text: the impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the covid epidemic in mainland china a data driven seiqr model study the outbreak of coronavirus disease covid which originated in wuhan china constitutes a public health emergency of international concern with a very high risk of spread and impact at the global level we developed data driven susceptible exposed infectious quarantine recovered seiqr models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size as of jan the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was ci with days of substantial social distancing the reproductive number in wuhan and hubei was reduced from ci to ci and in other provinces from ci to ci we found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland china the number of infections could be reduced up to and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to as of feb however earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect because it would cause in situ deteriorating which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter to minimize the epidemic size and death stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first then in the province and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost effective

Text: modeling state estimation and optimal control for the us covid outbreak the novel coronavirus sars cov and resulting covid disease have had an unprecedented spread and continue to cause an increasing number of fatalities worldwide while vaccines are still under development social distancing extensive testing and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the most effective measures to contain the pandemic these measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost in this work we introduce a novel optimization based decision making framework for managing the covid outbreak in the us this includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized the analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact further we find that on off policies alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can be effective at flattening the curve while likely minimizing social and economic cost

Text: modeling the impact of social distancing testing contact tracing and household quarantine on second wave scenarios of the covid epidemic the new coronavirus disease covid has required the implementation of severe mobility restrictions and social distancing measures worldwide while these measures have been proven effective in abating the epidemic in several countries it is important to estimate the effectiveness of testing and tracing strategies to avoid a potential second wave of the covid epidemic we integrate highly detailed anonymized privacy enhanced mobility data from mobile devices with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent based model to describe the transmission dynamics of sars cov in the boston metropolitan area we find that enforcing strict social distancing followed by a policy based on a robust level of testing contact tracing and household quarantine could keep the disease at a level that does not exceed the capacity of the health care system assuming the identification of of the symptomatic infections and the tracing of of their contacts and households which corresponds to about of individuals quarantined the ensuing reduction in transmission allows the reopening of economic activities while attaining a manageable impact on the health care system our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can play a major role in relaxing social distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against sars cov
