Text: eicosanoids the overlooked storm in covid severe coronavirus covid symptoms including systemic inflammatory response and multi system organ failure are now affecting thousands of infected patients and causing widespread mortality coronavirus infection causes tissue damage which triggers the endoplasmic reticulum er stress response and subsequent eicosanoid and cytokine storms while pro inflammatory eicosanoids including prostaglandins thromboxanes and leukotrienes are critical mediators of physiological processes such as inflammation fever allergy and pain their role in covid are poorly characterized arachidonic acid derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids eets could alleviate the systemic hyper inflammatory response in covid infection by modulating er stress and stimulating the resolution of inflammation soluble epoxide hydrolase seh inhibitors which increase endogenous eet levels exhibit potent anti inflammatory activity and inhibit various pathologic processes in preclinical disease models including pulmonary fibrosis thrombosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome therefore targeting eicosanoids and seh could be a novel therapeutic approach in combating covid in this review we discuss the predominant role of eicosanoids in regulating the inflammatory cascade and propose the potential application of seh inhibitors in alleviating covid symptoms we also discuss the host protective action of omega fatty acid derived epoxyeicosanoids and specialized pro resolving mediators spms in regulating anti inflammation and anti viral response future studies determining the eicosanoid profile in covid patient or preclinical model are pivotal in providing the novel insight of coronavirus host interaction and inflammation modulation

Text: single cell analysis of severe covid patients reveals a monocyte driven inflammatory storm attenuated by tocilizumab despite the current devastation of the covid pandemic several recent studies have suggested that the immunosuppressive drug tocilizumab can powerfully treating inflammatory responses that occur in this disease here by employing single cell analysis of the immune cell composition of severe stage covid patients and these same patients in post tocilizumab treatment remission we have identified a monocyte subpopulation specific to severe disease that contributes to inflammatory storms in covid patients although tocilizumab treatment attenuated the strong inflammatory immune response we found that immune cells including plasma b cells and cd t cells still exhibited an intense humoral and cell mediated anti virus immune response in covid patients after tocilizumab treatment thus in addition to providing a rich very high resolution data resource about the immune cell distribution at multiple stages of the covid disease our work both helps explain tocilizumab s powerful therapeutic effects and defines a large number of potential new drug targets related to inflammatory storms

Text: imbalanced host response to sars cov drives development of covid viral pandemics such as the one caused by sars cov pose an imminent threat to humanity because of its recent emergence there is a paucity of information regarding viral behavior and host response following sars cov infection here we offer an in depth analysis of the transcriptional response to sars cov compared with other respiratory viruses cell and animal models of sars cov infection in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of covid patients consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response this response is defined by low levels of type i and iii interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of il we propose that reduced innate antiviral defenses coupled with exuberant inflammatory cytokine production are the defining and driving features of covid

Text: inflammatory and coagulative considerations for the management of orthopaedic trauma patients with covid a review of the current evidence and our surgical experience mounting evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease covid involves a hyperinflammatory response predisposing patients to thromboembolic disease and acute respiratory distress in the setting of severe blunt trauma damaged tissues induce a local and systemic inflammatory response through similar pathways to covid as such patients with covid sustaining orthopaedic trauma injuries may have an amplified response to the traumatic insult because of their baseline hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states these patients may have compromised physiological reserve to withstand the insult of surgical intervention before reaching clinical instability in this article we review the current evidence regarding pathogenesis of covid and its implications on the management of orthopaedic trauma patients by discussing a case and the most recent literature

Text: covid a collision of complement coagulation and inflammatory pathways covid is frequently accompanied by a hypercoagulable inflammatory state with microangiopathic pulmonary changes that can precede the diffuse alveolar damage characteristic of typical ards seen in other severe pathogenic infections parallels with systemic inflammatory disorders such as atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome ahus have implicated the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of covid and particularly the anaphylatoxins c a and c a released from cleavage of c and c respectively c a is a potent cell signalling protein that activates a cytokine storm a hyper inflammatory phenomenon within hours of infection and the innate immune response however excess c a can result in a pro inflammatory environment orchestrated through a plethora of mechanisms that propagates lung injury lymphocyte exhaustion and an immune paresis furthermore disruption of the homeostatic interactions between complement and extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways contributes to a net pro coagulant state in the microvasculature of critical organs fatal covid has been associated with a systemic inflammatory response accompanied by a pro coagulant state and organ damage particularly microvascular thrombi in the lungs and kidneys pathologic studies report strong evidence of complement activation c blockade reduces inflammatory cytokines and their manifestations in animal studies and has shown benefits in patients with ahus prompting investigation of this approach in the treatment of covid this review describes the role of the complement pathway and particularly c a and its aberrations in highly pathogenic virus infections and therefore its potential as a therapeutic target in covid

Text: commentary phosphodiesterase inhibitors as potential adjunct treatment targeting the cytokine storm in covid the most severe presentation of covid is characterized by a hyperinflammatory state attributed to the massive pro inflammatory cytokine release called cytokine storm several specific anti inflammatory immunosuppressive agents are being evaluated by ongoing clinical trials however there is currently insufficient evidence for their efficacy and safety in covid treatment given the role of phosphodiesterase pde and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the inflammatory response we hypothesize that selective pde inhibition may attenuate the cytokine storm in covid through the upstream inhibition of pro inflammatory molecules particularly tnf α and the regulation of the pro inflammatory anti inflammatory balance conversely other anti cytokine agents lead to the downstream inhibition of specific targets such as il il or tnf α and may not be efficient in blocking the cytokine storm once it has been triggered due to their mechanism of action targeting an early stage of the inflammatory response and ameliorating lung inflammation we believe that selective pde inhibitors may represent a promising treatment option for the early phase of covid pneumonia before the cytokine storm and severe multiorgan dysfunction take place furthermore pde inhibitors present several advantages including an excellent safety profile the oral route of administration the convenient dosing and beneficial metabolic properties interestingly obesity and diabetes mellitus type have been reported to be risk factors for the severity of covid therefore randomized clinical trials of pde inhibitors are necessary to explore their potential therapeutic effect as an adjunct to supportive measures and other therapeutic regiments
