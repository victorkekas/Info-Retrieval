Text: human coronavirus nl associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms in early life coronavirus nl has been identified as a new member of the coronavirus genus but its role as a cause of respiratory disease needs to be established we studied the first episode of lower respiratory tract symptoms in a cohort of healthy neonates nl was identified in of cases and was as frequent as other coronaviruses nl was recovered at the onset of symptoms and was cleared within weeks in half of the cases our data suggests that coronavirus nl causes lower respiratory tract symptoms and is acquired in early life

Text: association of chemosensory dysfunction and covid in patients presenting with influenza like symptoms background rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and concern for viral transmission by ambulatory patients with minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of coronavirus disease covid infection two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste understanding the timing and association of smell taste loss in covid may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases methods a single institution cross sectional study evaluating patient reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for covid logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with covid positivity results a total of patients with influenza like symptoms underwent covid testing between march and march our study captured of covid positive patients and of covid negative patients smell and taste loss were reported in and of covid positive subjects respectively compared to and of covid negative patients p smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with covid positivity anosmia adjusted odds ratio aor ci ageusia aor ci whereas sore throat was associated with covid negativity aor ci of patients who reported covid associated loss of smell reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness conclusion in ambulatory individuals with influenza like symptoms chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with covid infection and should be considered when screening symptoms most will recover chemosensory function within weeks paralleling resolution of other disease related symptoms

Text: abdominal pain a real challenge in novel covid infection covid coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus ncov since its detection in china at the end of the novel coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world and has caused an international public health emergency the most common manifestation is flu like symptoms mild infections usually improve within a few days but covid can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a covid syndrome in line with the current opinion of the who we strongly believe that preventive measures and early diagnosis of covid are crucial to interrupt virus spread and avoid local outbreaks we report the cases of covid patients admitted to our emergency department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission learning points the novel covid infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide although uncommon there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and covid as reported in recent studies early detection and isolation of patients with covid infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus

Text: bets the dangers of selection bias in early analyses of the coronavirus disease covid pandemic the coronavirus disease covid has quickly grown from a regional outbreak in wuhan china to a global pandemic early estimates of the epidemic growth and incubation period of covid may have been biased due to sample selection using detailed case reports from locations in and outside mainland china we obtained wuhan exported cases who left wuhan before an abrupt travel quarantine we developed a generative model we call bets for four key epidemiological events beginning of exposure end of exposure time of transmission and time of symptom onset bets and derived explicit formulas to correct for the sample selection we gave a detailed illustration of why some early and highly influential analyses of the covid pandemic were severely biased all our analyses regardless of which subsample and model were being used point to an epidemic doubling time of to days during the early outbreak in wuhan a bayesian nonparametric analysis further suggests that about of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within days of infection and that men may be much more likely than women to develop symptoms within days of infection
