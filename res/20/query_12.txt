Text: what is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus sars cov upon lifting the metropolitan wide quarantine of wuhan city china background the chinese government implemented a metropolitan wide quarantine of wuhan city on rd january to curb the epidemic of the coronavirus covid lifting of this quarantine is imminent we modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted method we constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the covid epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic results we estimated that at the end of the epidemic a total of individuals would be infected by the virus among which would be infected through public contacts through household contact through hospital contacts including non covid patients and medical staff members a total of would die of covid related pneumonia in wuhan for an early lifting date st march facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate if public contacts were to recover to of the pre quarantine level in contrast lifting the quarantine on th april allowed public person to person contact adjusted back to the pre quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage however a low facial mask usage would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios lifting the quarantine on th april would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage conclusion the prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate

Text: effectiveness and cost effectiveness of public health measures to control covid a modelling study background the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov was first reported in china which caused a respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease covid since its discovery the virus has spread to over countries and claimed more than deaths this study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of various response public health measures method the stochastic agent based model was used to simulate the process of covid outbreak in scenario i imported one case and ii imported four cases with a series of public health measures involving the personal protection isolation and quarantine gathering restriction and community containment the virtual community was constructed following the susceptible latent infectious recovered framework the epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation the main outcomes included avoided infectors cost effectiveness ratios cers and incremental cost effectiveness ratios icers the sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty findings in scenario i and ii the isolation and quarantine averted and humans infected respectively at the cost of us and us both with negative value of icers the joint strategy of personal protection and isolation and quarantine could avert one more case than single isolation and quarantine with additional cost of us and us respectively the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine decreased as lowering quarantine probability and increasing delay time especially in scenario ii when the quarantine probability was less than the number of infections raised sharply when the quarantine delay time reached six days more than a quarter of individuals would be infected in the community the strategy including community containment could protect more lives and was cost effective when the number of imported cases was no less than or the delay time of quarantine was more than five days or the quarantine probability was below based on current assumptions interpretation the isolation and quarantine was the most cost effective intervention however personal protection and isolation and quarantine was the optimal strategy averting more infectors than single isolation and quarantine certain restrictions should be considered such as more initial imported cases longer quarantine delay time and lower quarantine probability

Text: quarantine for sars taiwan during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in taiwan persons were quarantined of whom were later found to have laboratory confirmed sars coronavirus sars cov infection since no evidence exists that sars cov is infective before the onset of symptoms and the quarantined persons were exposed but not symptomatic we thought the quarantine s effectiveness should be investigated using the taiwan quarantine data we found that the onset to diagnosis time of previously quarantined confirmed case patients was significantly shortened compared to that for those who had not been quarantined thus quarantine for sars in taiwan screened potentially infective persons for swift diagnosis and hospitalization after onset thereby indirectly reducing infections full scale quarantine measures implemented on april led to a significant improvement in onset to diagnosis time of all sars patients regardless of previous quarantine status we discuss the temporal effects of quarantine measures and other interventions on detection and isolation as well as the potential usefulness of quarantine in faster identification of persons with sars and in improving isolation measures
