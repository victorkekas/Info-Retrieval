Text: phylogenetic analysis of the full length sars cov sequences evidence for phylogenetic discordance in three genomic regions the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov remains unclear evidence based on bayesian scanning plots and phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood ml and bayesian methods indicates that sars cov for the largest part of the genome is more closely related to group ii coronaviruses sequences whereas in three regions in the orf ab gene it shows no apparent similarity to any of the previously characterized groups of coronaviruses there is discordant phylogenetic clustering of sars cov and coronaviruses sequences throughout the genome compatible with either ancient recombination events or altered evolutionary rates in different lineages or a combination of both j med virol wiley liss inc

Text: analysis on the sars cov genome of pumc isolate objective to perform variation and phylogenetics analysis on the sars cov genome sequence pumc isolated in the peking union medical college hospital methods the cdna library of sars cov pumc isolate was constructed by means of random priming strategy random selected plasmid was sequenced and the genome sequence of sars cov pumc was assembled by conventional methods the genebank accession no of sars cov pumc is ay the variation and phylogenetics analysis were performed by comparing the pumc sequence with other sars cov isolates results ten variation sites were found by comparing pumc isolate with tor and urbani isolates in phylogenetic analysis of sars cov isolates two classes were observed and there is different differential time between these two classes and the different isolates in each class conclusions the evidence of phylogenetic analysis of different sars cov isolates from different region is instructive for understanding the clinical relations between the different isolates and the transmission chain of sars cov

Text: detailed phylogenetic analysis of sars cov reveals latent capacity to bind human ace receptor sars cov is a once in a century pandemic having emerged suddenly as a highly infectious viral pathogen previous phylogenetic analyses show its closest known evolutionary relative to be a virus isolated from bats ratg with a common assumption that sars cov evolved from a zoonotic ancestor via recent genetic changes likely in the spike protein receptor binding domain or rbd that enabled it to infect humans we used detailed phylogenetic analysis ancestral sequence reconstruction and molecular dynamics simulations to examine the spike rbd s functional evolution finding to our surprise that it has likely possessed high affinity for human cell targets since at least

Text: sars cov molecular and phylogenetic analysis in covid patients a preliminary report from iran background the aim of the current study was to investigate and track the sars cov in iranian coronavirus disease covid patients using molecular and phylogenetic methods methods we enrolled seven confirmed cases of covid patients for the phylogenetic assessment of the sars cov in iran the nsp nsp and s genes were amplified using one step rt pcr and sequenced using sanger sequencing method popular bioinformatics software were used for sequences alignment and analysis as well as phylogenetic construction results the mean age of the patients in the present study was years and were male the results indicated high similarity between iranian and chinese strains we could not find any particular polymorphisms in the assessed regions of the three genes phylogenetic trees by neighbor joining and maximum likelihood method of nsp nsp and s genes showed that there are not any differences between iranian isolates and those of other countries conclusion as a preliminary phylogenetic study in iranian sars cov isolates we found that these isolates are closely related to the chinese and reference sequences also no sensible differences were observed between iranian isolates and those of other countries further investigations are recommended using more comprehensive methods and larger sample sizes

Text: genetic distance of sars coronavirus from the recent natural case abstract phylogenetic analysis of sars coronavirus isolates based on the spike gene and protein sequence using neighbor joining maximum likelihood and bayesian inference methods indicated that a recent human sars cov isolate was closer to some human sars cov isolates from earlier epidemic phase than to the sars cov like viruses isolated from wild animals during previous epidemic phase a reasonable judgment based on phylogenetic relationship and sequence variations it is likely that the recent human sars cov isolate is closer to an unknown sars cov predecessor

Text: monophyletic relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and group coronaviruses although primary genomic analysis has revealed that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov is a new type of coronavirus the different protein trees published in previous reports have provided no conclusive evidence indicating the phylogenetic position of sars cov to clarify the phylogenetic relationship between sars cov and other coronaviruses we compiled a large data set composed of concatenated protein sequences and performed comprehensive analyses using the maximum likelihood bayesian inference and maximum parsimony methods all resulting phylogenetic trees displayed an identical topology and supported the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group covs is monophyletic relationships among all major groups were well resolved and were supported by all statistical analyses
