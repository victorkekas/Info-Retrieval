Text: genomic characterisation and phylogenetic analysis of sars cov in italy this report describes the isolation the molecular characterization and the phylogenetic analysis of the first three complete genomes of sars cov isolated from three patients involved in the first outbreak of covid in lombardy italy early molecular epidemiological tracing suggests that sars cov was present in italy weeks before the first reported cases of infection

Text: analysis on the sars cov genome of pumc isolate objective to perform variation and phylogenetics analysis on the sars cov genome sequence pumc isolated in the peking union medical college hospital methods the cdna library of sars cov pumc isolate was constructed by means of random priming strategy random selected plasmid was sequenced and the genome sequence of sars cov pumc was assembled by conventional methods the genebank accession no of sars cov pumc is ay the variation and phylogenetics analysis were performed by comparing the pumc sequence with other sars cov isolates results ten variation sites were found by comparing pumc isolate with tor and urbani isolates in phylogenetic analysis of sars cov isolates two classes were observed and there is different differential time between these two classes and the different isolates in each class conclusions the evidence of phylogenetic analysis of different sars cov isolates from different region is instructive for understanding the clinical relations between the different isolates and the transmission chain of sars cov
