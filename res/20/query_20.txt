Text: effects of angiotensin ii receptor blockers and ace angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on virus infection inflammatory status and clinical outcomes in patients with covid and hypertension a single center retrospective study with the capability of inducing elevated expression of ace angiotensin converting enzyme the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs or ace inhibitors treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation we aimed to evaluate the effects of arbs ace inhibitors on coronavirus disease covid in a retrospective single center study one hundred twenty six patients with covid and preexisting hypertension at hubei provincial hospital of traditional chinese medicine in wuhan from january to february were retrospectively allocated to arbs ace inhibitors group n and non arbs ace inhibitors group n according to their antihypertensive medication one hundred twenty five age and sex matched patients with covid without hypertension were randomly selected as nonhypertension controls in addition the medication history of patients with hypertension that were admitted to hubei provincial hospital of traditional chinese medicine from november to december before the covid outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison epidemiological demographic clinical and laboratory data were collected analyzed and compared between these groups the frequency of arbs ace inhibitors usage in patients with hypertension with or without covid were comparable among patients with covid and hypertension those received either arbs ace inhibitors or non arbs ace inhibitors had comparable blood pressure however arbs ace inhibitors group had significantly lower concentrations of hs crp high sensitivity c reactive protein p and pct procalcitonin p furthermore a lower proportion of critical patients versus p and a lower death rate versus p were observed in arbs ace inhibitors group than non arbs ace inhibitors group although these differences failed to reach statistical significance our findings thus support the use of arbs ace inhibitors in patients with covid and preexisting hypertension

Text: rethinking the renin angiotensin system and its role in cardiovascular regulation angiotensin converting enzyme ace plays a pivotal role in the renin angiotensin system ras and ace inhibitors are widely used in several clinical conditions including hypertension and heart failure recently a homologue of ace ace has been discovered both ace and ace are emerging as key enzymes of the ras where ace may play a role as negative regulator of ace moreover ace appears to be an important enzyme outside the classical ras as it hydrolyzes apelins dynorphin a des arg bradykinin and other peptide substrates the precise interplay between tissue ace ace and their substrates and by products are presently still unclear ace inhibitors reduce angiotensin ii formation and bradykinin degradation but do not inhibit ace activity moreover ace inhibitors differ in their affinity for tissue ace and it has been suggested that tissue ace affinity might be responsible for some of the beneficial properties of these drugs ace inhibitors also increase nitric oxide availability and activate several kinases that may regulate protein synthesis by interacting with the nucleus of the cells outside in signaling the outside in signaling may also be activated by bradykinin itself although the precise significance of the outside in signaling is still unclear this new role of ace inhibitors may represent a discriminant factor versus angiotensin ii receptors antagonists this mini review will summarize some new aspects concerning the recently discovered biological functions of ras and in particular of ace ace and ace inhibitors in cardiovascular system
