Text: estimation of covid under reporting in brazilian states through sari due to its impact covid has been stressing the academy to search for curing mitigating or controlling it however when it comes to controlling there are still few studies focused on under reporting estimates it is believed that under reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and if not considered can cause significant misinformation therefore the objective of this work is to estimate the under reporting of cases and deaths of covid in brazilian states using data from the infogripe on notification of severe acute respiratory infection sari the methodology is based on the concepts of inertia and the use of event detection techniques to study the time series of hospitalized sari cases the estimate of real cases of the disease called novelty is calculated by comparing the difference in sari cases in after covid with the total expected cases in recent years to derived from a seasonal exponential moving average the results show that under reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in brazil

Text: estimating the unreported number of novel coronavirus ncov cases in china in the first half of january a data driven modelling analysis of the early outbreak background in december an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus ncov emerged in wuhan china and has swiftly spread to other parts of china and a number of foreign countries the ncov cases might have been under reported roughly from to january and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number r of ncov methods we modelled the epidemic curve of ncov cases in mainland china from december to january through the exponential growth the number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation we used the serial intervals si of infection caused by two other well known coronaviruses cov severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers covs as approximations of the unknown si for ncov to estimate r results we confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern the under reporting was likely to have resulted in ci unreported cases from to january the reporting rate after january was likely to have increased fold ci in comparison to the situation from to january on average we estimated the r of ncov at ci conclusion the under reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of january and should be considered in future investigation

Text: analysis of covid under reporting in brazil objective to estimate the reporting rates of coronavirus disease covid cases for brazil as a whole and states methods we estimated the actual number of covid cases using the reported number of deaths in brazil and each state and the expected case fatality ratio from the world health organization brazil s expected case fatality ratio was also adjusted by the population s age pyramid therefore the notification rate can be defined as the number of confirmed cases notified by the ministry of health divided by the number of expected cases estimated from the number of deaths results the reporting rate for covid in brazil was estimated at ci with all the states presenting rates below são paulo and rio de janeiro the most populated states in brazil showed small reporting rates and respectively the highest reporting rate occurred in roraima and the lowest in paraiba conclusion the results indicated that the reporting of confirmed cases in brazil is much lower as compared to other countries we analyzed therefore decision makers including the government fail to know the actual dimension of the pandemic which may interfere with the determination of control measures

Text: bayesian modeling of covid cases with a correction to account for under reported cases the novel of covid disease started in late making the worldwide governments came across a high number of critical and death cases beyond constant fear of the collapse in their health systems since the beginning of the pandemic researchers and authorities are mainly concerned with carrying out quantitative studies modeling and predictions overcoming the scarcity of tests that lead us to under reporting cases to address these issues we introduce a bayesian approach to the sir model with correction for under reporting in the analysis of covid cases in brazil the proposed model was enforced to obtain estimates of important quantities such as the reproductive rate and the average infection period along with the more likely date when the pandemic peak may occur several under reporting scenarios were considered in the simulation study showing how impacting is the lack of information in the modeling

Text: the covid sars cov uncertainty tripod in brazil assessments on model based predictions with large under reporting the covid pandemic sars cov virus is the defying global health crisis of our time the absence of mass testing and the relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals causes the available data of the covid pandemic in brazil to be largely under reported regarding the number of infected individuals and deaths we propose an adapted susceptible infected recovered sir model which explicitly incorporates the under reporting and the response of the population to public policies such as confinement measures widespread use of masks etc to cast short term and long term predictions large amounts of uncertainty could provide misleading models and predictions in this paper we discuss the role of uncertainty in these prediction which is illustrated regarding three key aspects first assuming that the number of infected individuals is under reported we demonstrate an anticipation regarding the peak of infection furthermore while a model with a single class of infected individuals yields forecasts with increased peaks a model that considers both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals suggests a decrease of the peak of symptomatic second considering that the actual amount of deaths is larger than what is being register then demonstrate the increase of the mortality rates third when consider generally under reported data we demonstrate how the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change qualitatively and quantitatively we also investigate the effect of the covid under reporting tripod i e the under reporting in terms of infected individuals of deaths and the true mortality rate if two of these factors are known the remainder can be inferred as long as proportions are kept constant the proposed approach allows one to determine the margins of uncertainty by assessments on the observed and true mortality rates

Text: under reporting of tb cases and associated factors a case study in china background tuberculosis is a leading cause of death worldwide and has become a high global health priority accurate country level surveillance is critical to ending the pandemic effective routine reporting systems which track the course of the epidemic are vital in addressing tb china which has the third largest tb epidemic in the world and has developed a reporting system to help with the control and prevention of tb this study examined its effectiveness in eastern china methods the number of tb cases reported internally in two hospitals in eastern china were compared to the number tb cases reported by these same hospitals in the national reporting systems in order to assess the accuracy of reporting qualitative data from interviews with key health officials and researcher experience using the tb reporting systems were used to identify factors affecting the accuracy of tb cases being reported in the national systems results this study found that over a quarter of tb cases recorded in the internal hospital records were not entered into the national tb reporting systems leading to an under representation of national tb cases factors associated with underreporting included unqualified and overworked health personnel poor supervision and accountability at local and national levels and a complicated incohesive health information management system conclusions this study demonstrates that tb in eastern china is being underreported given that eastern china is a developed province one could assume similar problems may be found in other parts of china with fewer resources as well as many low and middle income countries having an accurate account of the number of national tb cases is essential to understanding the national and global burden of the disease and in managing tb prevention and control efforts as such factors associated with underreporting need to be addressed in order to reduce underreporting
