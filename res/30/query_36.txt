Text: structural basis of sars cov spike protein priming by tmprss entry of sars cov etiological agent of covid in the host cell is driven by the interaction of its spike protein with human ace receptor and a serine protease tmprss although complex between sars cov spike protein and ace has been structurally resolved the molecular details of the sars cov and tmprss complex are still elusive tmprss is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites arg ser and arg ser the present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between tmprss and sars cov spike protein in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets briefly full length structural model of tmprss was developed and docked against the resolved structure of sars cov spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites the docking simulations showed that tmprss interacts with the two different loops of sars cov spike protein each containing different cleavage sites key functional residues of tmprss his ser and ser were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of sars cov spike protein compared to the n terminal cleavage site arg ser tmprss region that interact with c terminal cleavage site arg ser of the sars cov spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable in summary the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between human tmprss and sars cov spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing

Text: cov d a database of high resolution coronavirus protein structures the sars cov virus is the cause of the current covid pandemic and exemplifies the general threat to global health posed by coronaviruses the urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of sars cov proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities to assist structure based design of vaccines and therapeutics against sars cov and other coronaviruses we developed cov d a database and molecular viewer of sars cov and other coronavirus protein structures updated weekly cov d annotates structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies receptors and small molecules additionally cov d provides information on spike glycoprotein sequence variability and polymorphisms and maps these features onto the spike structure in the integrated molecular viewer in order to further aid structure based design and analysis cov d includes viewable and downloadable spike glycoprotein structures with modeled glycosylation from rosetta cov d is available at https cov d ibbr umd edu
