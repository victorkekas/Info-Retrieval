Text: the unexpected risks of covid on asthma control in children abstract much is being learned about clinical outcomes for adult covid patients with underlying chronic conditions however there is less coverage on how the covid pandemic impacts the management of chronic medical conditions in children and youth such as asthma asthma is a common chronic medical condition in children that is uniquely susceptible to changes brought upon by covid sudden dramatic changes in the environment medical practice and medication use have altered the asthma management landscape with potential impacts on asthma outcomes in this paper we review how changes in transportation and travel patterns school attendance physical activity and time spent indoors along with changes in healthcare delivery since the start of the pandemic all play a contributing role in asthma control in children we review potentially important influences of asthma control in children during the covid pandemic worthy of further study

Text: reduced inflammatory responses to sars cov infection in children presenting to hospital with covid in china background infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in children is associated with better outcomes than in adults the inflammatory response to covid infection in children remains poorly characterised methods we retrospectively analysed the medical records of laboratory confirmed covid patients aged month to years from wuhan and jingzhou of hubei province patients presented between january th and march th information on clinical features laboratory results plasma cytokines chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed findings children admitted to hospital with covid were more likely to be male and the median age was iqr years all but one patient with severe disease was aged under and the majority had significant co morbidities despite having viral pneumonia on ct scanning only patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin il il il tumour necrosis factor tnf alpha and interferon ifn gamma between patients with mild moderate or severe disease interpretations we demonstrated that the immune responses of children to covid infection is significantly different from that seen in adults our evidence suggests that sars cov does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or cytokine storm in children with covid and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease these data also imply anti cytokine therapies may not be effective in children with moderate covid
