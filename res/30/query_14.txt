Text: spatial super spreaders and super susceptibles in human movement networks as lockdowns and stay at home orders start to be lifted across the globe governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies in dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging if not practically impossible governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading indeed certain places like some people can be super spreaders is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs here we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super spreaders and the novel concept of super susceptibles i e respectively places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it our proposed data analytic framework is based on the daily aggregated ridership data of public transport in singapore by constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics we are able to pinpoint super spreader and super susceptible locations our results reveal that most super spreaders are also super susceptibles and that counterintuitively busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations our analysis is based on data from singapore but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center it therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness

Text: super spreaders in infectious diseases summary early studies that explored host pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others subsequently in what became known as the rule a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events this empirical rule was shown to govern inter individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts as compared to most others became known as super spreaders studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pandemic revealed that in the absence of super spreading events most individuals infect few if any secondary contacts the analysis of sars transmission and reports from other outbreaks unveil a complex scenario in which super spreading events are shaped by multiple factors including co infection with another pathogen immune suppression changes in airflow dynamics delayed hospital admission misdiagnosis and inter hospital transfers predicting and identifying super spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans

Text: super spreaders and the rate of transmission of the sars virus abstract we describe a stochastic small world network model of transmission of the sars virus unlike the standard susceptible infected removed models of disease transmission our model exhibits both geographically localised outbreaks and super spreaders moreover the combination of localised and long range links allows for more accurate modelling of partial isolation and various public health policies from this model we derive an expression for the probability of a widespread outbreak and a condition to ensure that the epidemic is controlled moreover multiple simulations are used to make predictions of the likelihood of various eventual scenarios for fixed initial conditions the main conclusions of this study are i super spreaders may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant ii consistent with previous reports extended exposure time beyond days i e significant nosocomial transmission was the key factor in the severity of the sars outbreak in hong kong and iii the spread of sars can be effectively controlled by either limiting long range links imposing a partial quarantine or enforcing rapid hospitalisation and isolation of symptomatic individuals

Text: unlinking super linkers the topology of epidemic response covid a key characteristic of the spread of infectious diseases is their ability to use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs this enables the pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population in this work we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within human contact networks proximity graphs experimental results of disease spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease spreading however to stop disease spreading contact tracing requires both significant visibility at least into the proximity graph and the ability to place half of the population under isolation we find that pro actively isolating super links key proximity encounters has significant benefits targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on visibility into the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak it turns out that isolating super spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less effective than targeting super links we highlight the important role of topology in epidemic outbreaks we argue that proactive innoculation of a population by disabling super links and super spreaders may have an important complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a sophisticated public health response to epidemic outbreaks

Text: clustering model for transmission of the sars virus application to epidemic control and risk assessment abstract we propose a new four state model for disease transmission and illustrate the model with data from the sars epidemic in hong kong the critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small world network of interconnected nodes each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes transmission can only propagate between linked nodes this model exhibits two features typical of sars transmission geographically localized outbreaks and super spreaders neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible infected removed models of disease transmission our analysis indicates that super spreaders may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant moreover we find that nosocomial transmission in hong kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to days the extent of the sars epidemic would have been minimal

Text: accounting for super spreading gives the basic reproduction number r of covid that is higher than initially estimated transmission of infectious diseases is characterized by the basic reproduction number r a metric used to assess the threat posed by an outbreak and inform proportionate preventive decision making based on individual case reports from the initial stage of the coronavirus disease epidemic r is often estimated to range between and in this report we show that a seir model that properly accounts for the distribution of the incubation period suggests that r lie in the range this estimate is based on the doubling time observed in the near exponential phases of the epidemic spread in china united states and six european countries to support our empirical estimation we analyze stochastic trajectories of the seir model showing that in the presence of super spreaders the calculations based on individual cases reported during the initial phase of the outbreak systematically overestimate the doubling time and thus underestimate the actual value of r

Text: importance of interaction structure and stochasticity for epidemic spreading a covid case study in the recent covid pandemic computer simulations are used to predict the evolution of the virus propagation and to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non pharmaceutical interventions as such the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision making typically ode based models are considered in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time in this work we translate an ode based covid spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures we observe a large dependency of the epidemic s dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph which is not adequately captured by existing ode models for instance existence of super spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super spreaders overall we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number r we conclude that deterministic models fitted to covid outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights

Text: spatially adjusted time varying reproductive numbers understanding the geographical expansion of urban dengue outbreaks the basic reproductive number r is a fundamental measure used to quantify the transmission potential of an epidemic in public health practice however r cannot reflect the time varying nature of an epidemic a time varying effective reproductive number r t can provide more information because it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission however since it neglects individual level geographical variations in exposure risk r t may smooth out interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential obscure high risk spreaders and hence hamper the effectiveness of control measures in spatial dimension therefore this study proposes a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted time varying reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals this new method estimates individual level effective reproductive numbers r j and a summarized indicator for population level time varying reproductive number r t data from the five most severe dengue outbreaks in southern taiwan from were used to demonstrate the ability of the method to highlight early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission our results show spatial heterogeneity in the transmission potential of dengue among individuals and identify the spreaders with the highest r j during the epidemic period the results also reveal that super spreaders are usually early spreaders that locate at the edges of the epidemic foci which means that these cases could be the drivers of the expansion of the outbreak therefore our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges of the epidemic foci which could be weak spots in disease control and prevention
