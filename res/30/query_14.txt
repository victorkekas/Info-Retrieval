Text: super spreader businesses and risk of covid transmission purpose the united states has the highest number of confirmed covid cases in the world to date with over covid related deaths the true risk of a covid resurgence as states prepare to reopen businesses is unknown this paper aims to classify businesses by their risk of transmission and quantify the relationship between the density of super spreader businesses and covid cases methods we constructed a covid business transmission risk index based upon the frequency and duration of visits and square footage of businesses pre pandemic in in states massachusetts rhode island connecticut new hampshire vermont maine new york and california we used this index to classify businesses as super spreaders then we analyzed the association between the density of super spreader businesses in a county and the rate of covid cases we performed significance testing using a negative binomial regression the main outcome of interest is the cumulative number of covid cases each week results we found a positive association between the density of super spreader businesses and covid cases a percentage point increase in the density of super spreader businesses is associated with higher covid cases all else equal conclusion higher densities of super spreader businesses are associated with higher rates of covid cases this may have important implications for how states reopen super spreader businesses

Text: spatial super spreaders and super susceptibles in human movement networks as lockdowns and stay at home orders start to be lifted across the globe governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies in dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging if not practically impossible governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading indeed certain places like some people can be super spreaders is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs here we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super spreaders and the novel concept of super susceptibles i e respectively places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it our proposed data analytic framework is based on the daily aggregated ridership data of public transport in singapore by constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics we are able to pinpoint super spreader and super susceptible locations our results reveal that most super spreaders are also super susceptibles and that counterintuitively busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations our analysis is based on data from singapore but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center it therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness

Text: risk factors for transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection during the outbreak in south korea background transmission heterogeneity was observed during the korean outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov infection only of cases transmitted the infection and super spreading events caused transmissions we investigated the risk factors for mers cov transmission methods epidemiological reports were used to classify patients as nonspreaders spreaders or those associated with a super spreading event or more transmissions logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the factors for mers cov transmission results compared to nonspreaders spreaders exhibited a longer interval from symptom onset to isolation days vs days and more frequent pre isolation pneumonia diagnoses vs spreaders also exhibited higher values for pre isolation contacts vs pre isolation hospitalization vs and emergency room er visits vs spreaders exhibited lower cycle thresholds for the upe and orf a genes vs and vs respectively in multivariate analysis transmission was independently associated with the cycle threshold odds ratio or confidence interval ci and pre isolation hospitalization or er visits or ci the super spreading events exhibited higher values for pre isolation contacts vs pre isolation er visits vs and doctor shopping vs compared to non super spreading events conclusions these findings indicate that transmission is determined by host infectivity and the number of contacts whereas super spreading events were determined by the number of contacts and hospital visits these relationships highlight the importance of rapidly enforcing infection control measures to prevent outbreaks

Text: covid super spreaders definitional quandaries and implications uncertainty around the role super spreaders play in the transmission and escalation of infectious disease is compounded by its broad and vague definition it is a term that has been much used in relation to covid particularly in social media on its widest definition it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people given the biological behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease it can potentially be used to describe events policies or settings this article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic one problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged super spreaders another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of covid transmission the author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition

Text: super spreaders in infectious diseases summary early studies that explored host pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others subsequently in what became known as the rule a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events this empirical rule was shown to govern inter individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts as compared to most others became known as super spreaders studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pandemic revealed that in the absence of super spreading events most individuals infect few if any secondary contacts the analysis of sars transmission and reports from other outbreaks unveil a complex scenario in which super spreading events are shaped by multiple factors including co infection with another pathogen immune suppression changes in airflow dynamics delayed hospital admission misdiagnosis and inter hospital transfers predicting and identifying super spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans

Text: characterizing super spreading in microblog an epidemic based information propagation model abstract as the microblogging services are becoming more prosperous in everyday life for users on online social networks osns it is more favorable for hot topics and breaking news to gain more attraction very soon than ever before which are so called super spreading events in the information diffusion process of these super spreading events messages are passed on from one user to another and numerous individuals are influenced by a relatively small portion of users a k a super spreaders acquiring an awareness of super spreading phenomena and an understanding of patterns of wide ranged information propagations benefits several social media data mining tasks such as hot topic detection predictions of information propagation harmful information monitoring and intervention taking into account that super spreading in both information diffusion and spread of a contagious disease are analogous in this study we build a parameterized model the sair model based on well known epidemic models to characterize super spreading phenomenon in tweet information propagation accompanied with super spreaders for the purpose of modeling information diffusion empirical observations on a real world weibo dataset are statistically carried out both the steady state analysis on the equilibrium and the validation on real world weibo dataset of the proposed model are conducted the case study that validates the proposed model shows that the sair model is much more promising than the conventional sir model in characterizing a super spreading event of information propagation in addition numerical simulations are carried out and discussed to discover how sensitively the parameters affect the information propagation process
