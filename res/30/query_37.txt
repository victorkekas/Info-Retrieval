Text: phylogenetic analysis of the full length sars cov sequences evidence for phylogenetic discordance in three genomic regions the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov remains unclear evidence based on bayesian scanning plots and phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood ml and bayesian methods indicates that sars cov for the largest part of the genome is more closely related to group ii coronaviruses sequences whereas in three regions in the orf ab gene it shows no apparent similarity to any of the previously characterized groups of coronaviruses there is discordant phylogenetic clustering of sars cov and coronaviruses sequences throughout the genome compatible with either ancient recombination events or altered evolutionary rates in different lineages or a combination of both j med virol wiley liss inc

Text: detailed phylogenetic analysis of sars cov reveals latent capacity to bind human ace receptor sars cov is a once in a century pandemic having emerged suddenly as a highly infectious viral pathogen previous phylogenetic analyses show its closest known evolutionary relative to be a virus isolated from bats ratg with a common assumption that sars cov evolved from a zoonotic ancestor via recent genetic changes likely in the spike protein receptor binding domain or rbd that enabled it to infect humans we used detailed phylogenetic analysis ancestral sequence reconstruction and molecular dynamics simulations to examine the spike rbd s functional evolution finding to our surprise that it has likely possessed high affinity for human cell targets since at least

Text: genome wide identification and characterization of point mutations in the sars cov genome objectives severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov emerged in wuhan china in december and has been rapidly spreading worldwide although the causal relationship among mutations and the features of sars cov such as rapid transmission pathogenicity and tropism remains unclear our results of genomic mutations in sars cov may help to interpret the interaction between genomic characterization in sars cov and infectivity with the host methods a total of genomic sequences of sars cov were collected from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid multiple sequence alignment for phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic approach for mutation analysis were conducted using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega and an in house program based on perl language respectively results phylogenetic analysis of sars cov strains indicated that there were major clades including s v and g and subclades g and g there were types of synonymous and types of non synonymous mutation orf a orf b s and n genes were detected at high frequency whereas orf b and e genes exhibited low frequency in the receptor binding domain rbd of the s gene non synonymous mutations were observed in the region adjacent to the angiotensin converting enzyme ace binding site conclusion it has been reported that the rapid infectivity and transmission of sars cov associated with host receptor affinity are derived from several mutations in its genes without these genetic mutations to enhance evolutionary adaptation species recognition host receptor affinity and pathogenicity it would not survive it is expected that our results could provide an important clue in understanding the genomic characteristics of sars cov

Text: snapshot of the evolution and mutation patterns of sars cov the covid pandemic is the most important public health threat in recent history here we study how its causal agent sars cov has diversified genetically since its first emergence in december we have created a pipeline combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human adaptation related mutations in a data set consisting of sars cov complete genome sequences although the phylogenetic diversity of sars cov is low the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values we also identified residues that are high frequency substitutions with four of them currently showing some signal for potential positive selection these fast evolving sites are in the non structural proteins nsp nsp cl protease nsp nsp polymerase and nsp helicase in accessory proteins orf a orf and in the structural proteins n and s temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an often local peak whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties we speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine tuning of adaptation to human cells our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of sars cov have changed during the epidemic
