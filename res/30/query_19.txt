Text: sanitizer aerosol driven ocular surface disease sadosd a covid repercussion since the onset of the covid pandemic there has been an advisory for regular and thorough cleaning of hands besides other measures such as social distancing and self isolation the rationale for the same is to prevent the transfer of the virus from hands that have come in contact with fomites while both alcohol based hand rubs abhr or washing with soap and water are claimed to have been effective hand sanitizers have gained more popularity due to the ease of use the increased frequency of abhr use and the aerosols generated pose a potential threat to the skin and exposed mucosal surfaces especially that of the eye due to the proximity of use the adverse effects of alcohol in these sanitizers can be manifold an allergic or inflammatory response can occur depending on the predisposing or preexisting conditions this article describes the risks underlying mechanisms and preventive measures for sanitizer aerosol driven ocular surface disease

Text: hand sanitizers a review of ingredients mechanisms of action modes of delivery and efficacy against coronaviruses background the emergence of the novel virus sars cov has posed unprecedented challenges to public health around the world currently strategies to deal with covid are purely supportive and preventative aimed at reducing transmission an effective and simple method for reducing transmission of infections in the public or healthcare settings is hand hygiene unfortunately little is known regarding the efficacy of hand sanitizers against sars cov methods in this review an extensive literature search was performed to succinctly summarize the primary active ingredients and mechanisms of action of hand sanitizers compare the effectiveness and compliance of gel and foam sanitizers and predict whether alcohol and non alcohol hand sanitizers would be effective against sars cov results most alcohol based hand sanitizers are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses including coronaviruses with what is currently known in the literature one may not confidently suggest one mode of hand sanitizing delivery over the other when hand washing with soap and water is unavailable a sufficient volume of sanitizer is necessary to ensure complete hand coverage and compliance is critical for appropriate hand hygiene conclusions by extrapolating effectiveness of hand sanitizers on viruses of similar structure to sars cov this virus should be effectively inactivated with current hand hygiene products though future research should attempt to determine this directly

Text: impact of non pharmaceutical interventions on uris and influenza in crowded urban households objectives we compared the impact of three household interventions education education with alcohol based hand sanitizer and education with hand sanitizer and face masks on incidence and secondary transmission of upper respiratory infections uris and influenza knowledge of transmission of uris and vaccination rates methods a total of primarily hispanic households participated participants reported symptoms twice weekly and nasal swabs were collected from those with an influenza like illness ili households were followed for up to months and home visits were made at least every two months results we recorded uris of which cases reported ilis and were laboratory confirmed cases of influenza demographic factors significantly associated with infection rates included age gender birth location education and employment the hand sanitizer group was significantly more likely to report that no household member had symptoms p or of members receiving influenza vaccine increased during the study p despite the fact that compliance with mask wearing was poor mask wearing as well as increased crowding lower education levels of caretakers and index cases years of age compared with adults were associated with significantly lower secondary transmission rates all p conclusions in this population there was no detectable additional benefit of hand sanitizer or face masks over targeted education on overall rates of uris but mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations during the study period community concern about methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus was occurring perhaps contributing to the use of hand sanitizer in the education control group and diluting the intervention s measurable impact

Text: redesigning a large school based clinical trial in response to changes in community practice background asthma exacerbations are seasonal with the greatest risk in elementary age students occurring shortly after returning to school following summer break recent research suggests that this seasonality in children is primarily related to viral respiratory tract infections regular hand washing is the most effective method to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections unfortunately achieving hand washing recommendations in schools is difficult therefore we designed a study to evaluate the effect of hand sanitizer use in elementary schools on exacerbations among children with asthma purpose to describe the process of redesigning the trial in response to changes in the safety profile of the hand sanitizer as well as changes in hand hygiene practice in the schools methods the original trial was a randomized longitudinal subject blinded placebo controlled community based crossover trial the primary aim was to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of hand sanitizer use in addition to usual hand hygiene practices to decrease asthma exacerbations in elementary age children three events occurred that required major modifications to the original study protocol safety concerns arose regarding the hand sanitizer s active ingredient no substitute placebo hand sanitizer was available and community preferences changed regarding hand hygiene practices in the schools results the revised protocol is a randomized longitudinal community based crossover trial the primary aim is to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of a two step hand hygiene process hand hygiene education plus institutionally provided alcohol based hand sanitizer versus usual care to decrease asthma exacerbations enrollment was completed in may with students from schools the intervention began in august and will continue through may study results should be available at the end of limitations the changed design does not allow us to directly measure the effectiveness of hand sanitizer use as a supplement to traditional hand washing practices conclusions the need to balance a rigorous study design with one that is acceptable to the community requires investigators to be actively involved with community collaborators and able to adapt study protocols to fit changing community practices
