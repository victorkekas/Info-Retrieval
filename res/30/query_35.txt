Text: does non covid lung lesion help investigating transferability in covid ct image segmentation coronavirus disease covid is a highly contagious virus spreading all around the world deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid covid detection and segmentation from computed tomography ct images the major challenge lies in the inadequate public covid datasets recently transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem however it remains unclear whether various non covid lung lesions could contribute to segmenting covid infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure this paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non covid lung lesions based on a publicly available covid ct dataset and three public non covid datasets we evaluate four transfer learning methods using d u net as a standard encoder decoder method the results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non covid lung lesions and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features leading to accurate and robust pre trained models we further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence in addition our proposed multi encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non covid datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement these findings promote new insights into transfer learning for covid ct image segmentation which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks

Text: covid mobility data collection of seoul south korea the relationship between pandemic and human mobility has received considerable attention from scholars as investigating such relationship can provide an indication of how human mobility changes in response to a public health crisis or whether reduced mobility contributes to preventing the spread of an infectious disease while several studies attempted to unveil this relationship no studies have focused on changes in mobility pattern at a finer scale utilizing high resolution datasets to address the complex association between pandemic s spread and human mobility this paper presents two categories of mobility datasets trip mode and trip purpose that concern nearly million citizens movements during the first days of covid in seoul south korea where no major lockdown has been imposed we curate hourly data of subway ridership traffic volume and population present count at selected points of interests the results to be derived from the presented datasets can be used as an important reference for public health decision making in the post covid era

Text: twitter sentiment classification for measuring public health concerns an important task of public health officials is to keep track of health issues such as spreading epidemics in this paper we are addressing the issue of spreading public concern about epidemics public concern about a communicable disease can be seen as a problem of its own keeping track of trends in concern about public health and identifying peaks of public concern are therefore crucial tasks however monitoring public health concerns is not only expensive with traditional surveillance systems but also suffers from limited coverage and significant delays to address these problems we are using twitter messages which are available free of cost are generated world wide and are posted in real time we are measuring public concern using a two step sentiment classification approach in the first step we distinguish personal tweets from news i e non personal tweets in the second step we further separate personal negative from personal non negative tweets both these steps consist themselves of two sub steps in the first sub step of both steps our programs automatically generate training data using an emotion oriented clue based method in the second sub step we are training and testing three different machine learning ml models with the training data from the first sub step this allows us to determine the best ml model for different datasets furthermore we are testing the already trained ml models with a human annotated disjoint dataset based on the number of tweets classified as personal negative we compute a measure of concern moc and a timeline of the moc we attempt to correlate peaks of the moc timeline to peaks of the news non personal timeline our best accuracy results are achieved using the two step method with a na√Øve bayes classifier for the epidemic domain six datasets and the mental health domain three datasets

Text: oscillations in usa covid incidence and mortality data reflect societal factors the covid pandemic currently in process differs from other infectious disease calamities that have previously plagued humanity in the vast amount of information that is produces each day which includes daily estimates of the disease incidence and mortality data apart from providing actionable information to public health authorities on the trend of the pandemic the daily incidence reflects the process of disease in a susceptible population and thus reflects the pathogenesis of covid the public health response and diagnosis and reporting both daily new cases and daily mortality data in the us exhibit periodic oscillatory patterns by analyzing nyc and la testing data we demonstrate that this oscillation in the number of cases can be strongly explained by the daily variation in testing this seems to rule out alternative hypotheses such as increased infections on certain days of the week as driving this oscillation similarly we show that the apparent oscillation in mortality in the us data is mostly an artifact of reporting which disappears in datasets that record death by episode date such as the nyc and la datasets periodic oscillations in covid incidence and mortality data reflect testing and reporting practices and contingencies thus these contingencies should be considered first prior to suggesting social or biological mechanisms
