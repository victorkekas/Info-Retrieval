Text: higher obesity trends among african americans are associated with increased mortality in infected covid patients within the city of detroit as the city of detroit raids itself of deaths by shifting from homicides covid infection continues to harrow the city with more deaths from march to may more detroiters died in months than were killed in years of city homicides african americans or blacks highest risk phenotypes developing covid infection are more likely to die disproportionately the confluence of diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease and the higher prevalence of obesity among blacks have provided the needed environment for viruses like covid to thrive and cause serious infections the purpose of this study is to connect mortality rates from covid infection to increasing obesity trends among african americans within the city of detroit statistical analyses were conducted using spss ver results showed that the highest mortality rates among african americans occurred more in the obese individuals infected with covid in the city of detroit out of deaths from covid infections deaths were due to obesity alone in patients without reported comorbid conditions like diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease mortality rate for both male and female african americans amounted to a total of thirty eight percent of reported covid infected african americans were obese electronic supplementary material the online version of this article s y contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users

Text: racial disparity of coronavirus disease covid in african american communities the covid pandemic has unveiled unsettling disparities in the outcome of the disease among african americans these disparities are not new but are rooted in structural inequities that must be addressed to adequately care for communities of color we describe the historical context of these structural inequities their impact on the progression of covid in the african american black community and suggest a multifaceted approach to addressing these healthcare disparities of note terminology from survey data cited for this article varied from blacks african americans or both for consistency we use african americans throughout

Text: differential expression of covid related genes in european americans and african americans the coronavirus disease covid pandemic has affected african american populations disproportionately in regards to both morbidity and mortality a multitude of factors likely account for this discrepancy gene expression represents the interaction of genetics and environment to elucidate whether levels of expression of genes implicated in covid vary in african americans as compared to european americans we re mine the cancer genome atlas tcga and genotype tissue expression gtex rna seq data multiple genes integral to infection inflammation and immunity are differentially regulated across the two populations most notably f a and f a which encode the hap protein that mediates early endosome movement in huntington s disease are more highly expressed by up to fold in african americans such differences in gene expression can establish prognostic signatures and have critical implications for precision treatment of diseases such as covid we advocate routine inclusion of information such as postal code education level and profession as a proxies for socioeconomic condition and race in the metadata about each individual sampled for sequencing studies this relatively simple change would enable large scale data driven approaches to dissect relationships among race socio economic factors and disease

Text: contemporary and future concepts on hypertension in african americans covid and beyond background cardiovascular disease related mortality is the leading cause of death in the united states with hypertension being the most prevalent and potent risk factor for decades hypertension has disproportionately affected african americans who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure methods current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in african americans in pubmed were reviewed we also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between covid and cardiovascular disease findings while apol has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors these factors include poor diet adverse lifestyle and social determinants hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet weight loss and adequate physical activity when lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension a common occurrence among african americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension pharmacological intervention is indicated the efficacy of renal denervation and the use of sodium glucose cotransporter and aminopeptidase a inhibitors have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension furthermore the recent covid crisis has been particularly devastating among african americans who demonstrate increased incidence and poorer health outcomes related to the disease conclusion the disparities in outcomes which are largely attributable to a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity in addition to adverse environmental and socioeconomic factors highlight the necessity of specialized clinical approaches and programs for african americans to address longstanding barriers to equitable care

Text: are clinicians contributing to excess african american covid deaths unbeknownst to them they may be african americans are overrepresented among reported coronavirus disease covid cases and deaths there are a multitude of factors that may explain the african american disparity in covid outcomes including higher rates of comorbidities while individual level factors predictably contribute to disparate covid outcomes systematic and structural factors have not yet been reported it stands to reason that implicit biases may fuel the racial disparity in covid outcomes to address this racial disparity we must apply a health equity lens and disaggregate data explicitly for african americans as well as other populations at risk for biased treatment in the health care system
