Text: clinical disease in children associated with newly described coronavirus subtypes objectives coronaviruses cause upper respiratory illness and occasionally lower tract disease in susceptible populations in this study we examined the prevalence of human coronaviruses including subtypes oc e and the recently described nl and hku in a pediatric population presenting to a children s hospital patients and methods specimens collected over a year period from pediatric patients presenting with acute respiratory illness were analyzed for the presence of coronavirus subtypes using consensus and subtype specific real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with coronavirus infection were examined retrospectively results coronaviruses were detected in of children eight and specimens were positive for subtypes e nl oc and hku respectively coronaviruses were detected throughout the study period all of the subtypes were present simultaneously in december the acute clinical features were similar across subtypes of children infected with a coronavirus as the sole respiratory pathogen had lower respiratory tract disease children whose only detectable respiratory virus was a coronavirus were more likely to have underlying chronic disease than were children coinfected with another respiratory virus conclusions although subtypes of coronavirus were detected the recently discovered coronavirus subtypes nl and hku accounted for the majority of coronaviruses detected in our cohort of mostly hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms new subtypes likely represent a substantial portion of previously unexplained respiratory illnesses

Text: the global population of sars cov is composed of six major subtypes the world health organization characterized the covid as a pandemic in march the second pandemic of the st century severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov is a positive stranded rna betacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae expanding virus populations as that of sars cov accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods in this context approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the sars cov population are necessary for a robust clustering here we proposed the subdivision of the global sars cov population into sixteen well defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural nsp nsp nsp nsp nsp and nsp cistrons structural spike and nucleocapsid and accessory orf genes six virus subtypes were predominant in the population but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications we hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the sars cov diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world a typical founder effect the genetic structure determined for the sars cov population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs

Text: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus elicits a weak interferon response compared to traditional interferon inducing viruses the aim of the present study is to investigate changes of interferon ifn production occurring over the first h after infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus cov and to compare these changes to those induced by well established ifn inducing viruses such as vesicular stomatitis vsv and newcastle viruses ndv experiments have been carried out using pbmcs of different healthy donors the results showed that the antiviral activity of ifn contained in the supernatant of sars cov infected pbmcs was lower than those induced by vsv and ndv consequently sars cov induces a lower synthesis of ifn α β and γ compared to vsv and ndv characterization of the profile of ifn α subtypes genes expression in sars cov infected pbmcs demonstrated that the level of ifn α and subtypes were higher compared to other ifn α subtypes namely ifn α and in conclusion sars cov induces ifns to a less extent compared to vsv and ndv thus suggesting that the ifn system does play a limited role in early host defense against sars cov infection

Text: a novel synonymous mutation of sars cov is this possible to affect their antigenicity and immunogenicity the s glycoprotein of coronaviruses is important for viral entry and pathogenesis with most variable sequences therefore we analyzed the s gene sequences of sars cov to better understand the antigenicity and immunogenicity of this virus in this study in phylogenetic analysis two subtypes sars cov a and b were confirmed within sars cov strains these two subtypes were divided by a novel synonymous mutation of d g this may play a crucial role in the evolution of sars cov to evade the host immune system the region containing this mutation point was confirmed as a b cell epitope located in the s domain and sars cov b strains exhibited severe reduced antigenic indexes compared to sars cov a in this area this may allow these two subtypes to have different antigenicity if the two subtypes have different serological characteristics a vaccine for both subtypes will be more effective to prevent covid thus further study is urgently required to confirm the antigenicity of these two subtypes

Text: highly frequent infections with human rhinovirus in healthy young children a longitudinal cohort study background human rhinoviruses hrvs are an important cause of respiratory tract infections objectives we questioned whether the high prevalence rates of hrvs found in epidemiological studies is due to long term individual continuity or a result of frequent infections with different hrv subtypes study design in a month winter period healthy controls aged years were at least sampled every two weeks for hrv pcr irrespective of respiratory symptoms all hrv positive samples were genotyped to determine hrv diversity results in total samples were collected hrv was found in samples genotyping revealed different hrv subtypes a median of different hrv subtypes was found per child re infections and continuity with identical hrv sequences were observed the number of hrvs were higher in the youngest age group p and they had more different hrv subtypes p compared to oldest age group conclusions we found a high hrv exposition with a considerable diverse population of hrv subtypes in young children these results have major implications for future research into the pathogenic role of hrv in respiratory diseases characterisation of subtypes will be necessary to discriminate between prolonged continuity and re infections in patients with respiratory diseases
