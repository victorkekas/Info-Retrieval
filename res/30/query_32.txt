Text: clinical disease in children associated with newly described coronavirus subtypes objectives coronaviruses cause upper respiratory illness and occasionally lower tract disease in susceptible populations in this study we examined the prevalence of human coronaviruses including subtypes oc e and the recently described nl and hku in a pediatric population presenting to a children s hospital patients and methods specimens collected over a year period from pediatric patients presenting with acute respiratory illness were analyzed for the presence of coronavirus subtypes using consensus and subtype specific real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with coronavirus infection were examined retrospectively results coronaviruses were detected in of children eight and specimens were positive for subtypes e nl oc and hku respectively coronaviruses were detected throughout the study period all of the subtypes were present simultaneously in december the acute clinical features were similar across subtypes of children infected with a coronavirus as the sole respiratory pathogen had lower respiratory tract disease children whose only detectable respiratory virus was a coronavirus were more likely to have underlying chronic disease than were children coinfected with another respiratory virus conclusions although subtypes of coronavirus were detected the recently discovered coronavirus subtypes nl and hku accounted for the majority of coronaviruses detected in our cohort of mostly hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms new subtypes likely represent a substantial portion of previously unexplained respiratory illnesses
