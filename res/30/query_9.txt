Text: canada needs to rapidly escalate public health interventions for its covid mitigation strategies background after the declaration of covid pandemic on march th local transmission chains starting in different countries including canada are forcing governments to take decisions on public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the epidemic methods we conduct data driven and model free estimations for the growth rates of the covid epidemics in italy and canada by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases we use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in canada under different scenarios of public health interventions results in italy the initial growth rate has reduced to two weeks after the lockdown of the country on march th this corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about to almost days in comparison the growth rate in canada has increased from between march st and th to between march th to nd this current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of days and therefore unless further public health interventions are escalated in canada we project cases by march st however the case number may be reduced to if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to the same level achieved in italy interpretation prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the covid epidemic in canada mitigation plans must take into account the delayed effect of interventions by up to weeks and the short doubling time of days

Text: the united states and canada as a coupled epidemiological system an example from hepatitis a background hepatitis a ha is a low incidence non endemic disease in canada and the united states us however a large difference in ha incidence between canada and ha endemic countries has made travel an important contributor to hepatitis a prevalence in canada there is also a smaller incidence differential between canada and the us although the us has only moderately higher ha incidence the volume of travel by canadians to the us is many times higher than travel volume to endemic countries hence travel to the us may constitute a source of low to moderate risk for canadian travelers to our knowledge travel to the us has never been included as a potential risk factor for ha infection in canadian epidemiologic analyses the objective of this study was to use dynamic models to investigate the possible effects on hepatitis a incidence in canada due to implementing vaccination in the us and varying the volume of travel by canadians to the us methods we developed and analyzed age structured compartmental models for the transmission and vaccination of hepatitis a for both canada and the us models were parameterized using data on seroprevalence case reporting and travel patterns the potential effect of hepatitis a prevalence in the us on hepatitis a prevalence in canada was captured through a term representing infection of canadians due to travel in the us results the model suggests that approximately of ha cases in canada in the mid s may have been attributable to travel to the us a universal vaccination programme that attained coverage in young children in the us in the mid s could have reduced canadian incidence by within years conclusion since not all necessary data were available to parameterize the model the results should be considered exploratory however the analysis shows that under plausible assumptions the us may be more important for determining ha prevalence in canada than is currently supposed as international travel continues to grow making vaccination policies ever more relevant to populations beyond a country s borders such multi country models will most likely come into wider use as predictive aids for policy development
