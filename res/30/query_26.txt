Text: human coronavirus nl associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms in early life coronavirus nl has been identified as a new member of the coronavirus genus but its role as a cause of respiratory disease needs to be established we studied the first episode of lower respiratory tract symptoms in a cohort of healthy neonates nl was identified in of cases and was as frequent as other coronaviruses nl was recovered at the onset of symptoms and was cleared within weeks in half of the cases our data suggests that coronavirus nl causes lower respiratory tract symptoms and is acquired in early life

Text: abdominal pain a real challenge in novel covid infection covid coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus ncov since its detection in china at the end of the novel coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world and has caused an international public health emergency the most common manifestation is flu like symptoms mild infections usually improve within a few days but covid can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a covid syndrome in line with the current opinion of the who we strongly believe that preventive measures and early diagnosis of covid are crucial to interrupt virus spread and avoid local outbreaks we report the cases of covid patients admitted to our emergency department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission learning points the novel covid infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide although uncommon there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and covid as reported in recent studies early detection and isolation of patients with covid infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus
