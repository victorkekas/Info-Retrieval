Text: a mathematical model reveals the influence of population heterogeneity on herd immunity to sars cov despite various levels of preventive measures in many countries have suffered severely from the coronavirus covid pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov virus we show that population heterogeneity can significantly impact disease induced immunity as the proportion infected in groups with the highest contact rates is greater than in groups with low contact rates we estimate that if r in an age structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity then the disease induced herd immunity level can be around which is substantially less than the classical herd immunity level of obtained through homogeneous immunization of the population our estimates should be interpreted as an illustration of how population heterogeneity affects herd immunity rather than an exact value or even a best estimate

Text: dendritic cell specific delivery of flt l by coronavirus vectors secures induction of therapeutic antitumor immunity efficacy of antitumor vaccination depends to a large extent on antigen targeting to dendritic cells dcs here we assessed antitumor immunity induced by attenuated coronavirus vectors which exclusively target dcs in vivo and express either lymphocyte or dc activating cytokines in combination with a gfp tagged model antigen tracking of in vivo transduced dcs revealed that vectors encoding for fms like tyrosine kinase ligand flt l exhibited a higher capacity to induce dc maturation compared to vectors delivering il or il moreover flt l vectors more efficiently induced tumor specific cd t cells expanded the epitope repertoire and provided both prophylactic and therapeutic tumor immunity in contrast il or il encoding vectors showed a substantially lower efficacy in cd t cell priming and failed to protect the host once tumors had been established thus specific in vivo targeting of dcs with coronavirus vectors in conjunction with appropriate conditioning of the microenvironment through flt l represents an efficient strategy for the generation of therapeutic antitumor immunity

Text: cross immunity between respiratory coronaviruses may limit covid fatalities of the seven coronaviruses associated with disease in humans sars cov mers cov and sars cov cause considerable mortality but also share significant sequence homology and potentially antigenic epitopes capable of inducing an immune response the degree of similarity is such that perhaps prior exposure to one virus could confer partial immunity to another indeed data suggests a considerable amount of cross reactivity and recognition by the hosts immune response between different coronavirus infections while the ongoing covid outbreak rapidly overwhelmed medical facilities of particularly europe and north america accounting for of global deaths only of deaths have occurred in asia where the outbreak originated interestingly asia and the middle east have previously experienced multiple rounds of coronavirus infections perhaps suggesting buildup of acquired immunity to the causative sars cov that underlies covid this article hypothesizes that a causative factor underlying such low morbidity in these regions is perhaps at least in part due to acquired immunity from multiple rounds of coronavirus infections and discusses the mechanisms and recent evidence to support such assertions further investigations of such phenomenon would allow us to examine strategies to confer protective immunity perhaps aiding vaccine development

Text: coronavirus membrane associated papain like proteases induce autophagy through interacting with beclin to negatively regulate antiviral innate immunity autophagy plays important roles in modulating viral replication and antiviral immune response coronavirus infection is associated with the autophagic process however little is known about the mechanisms of autophagy induction and its contribution to coronavirus regulation of host innate responses here we show that the membrane associated papain like protease plp plp tm of coronaviruses acts as a novel autophagy inducing protein intriguingly plp tm induces incomplete autophagy process by increasing the accumulation of autophagosomes but blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes furthermore plp tm interacts with the key autophagy regulators lc and beclin and promotes beclin interaction with sting the key regulator for antiviral ifn signaling finally knockdown of beclin partially reverses plp tm s inhibitory effect on innate immunity which resulting in decreased coronavirus replication these results suggested that coronavirus papain like protease induces incomplete autophagy by interacting with beclin which in turn modulates coronavirus replication and antiviral innate immunity
