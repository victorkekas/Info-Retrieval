Text: recent advances in the vaccine development against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a deadly viral respiratory disease caused by mers coronavirus mers cov infection to date there is no specific treatment proven effective against this viral disease in addition no vaccine has been licensed to prevent mers cov infection thus far therefore our current review focuses on the most recent studies in search of an effective mers vaccine overall vaccine candidates against mers cov are mainly based upon the viral spike s protein due to its vital role in the viral infectivity although several studies focused on other viral proteins such as the nucleocapsid n protein envelope e protein and non structural protein nsp have also been reported in general the potential vaccine candidates can be classified into six types viral vector based vaccine dna vaccine subunit vaccine nanoparticle based vaccine inactivated whole virus vaccine and live attenuated vaccine which are discussed in detail besides the immune responses and potential antibody dependent enhancement of mers cov infection are extensively reviewed in addition animal models used to study mers cov and evaluate the vaccine candidates are discussed intensively

Text: mers cov vaccine candidates in development the current landscape middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance has caused severe acute respiratory disease in more than people resulting in more than deaths the high case fatality rate growing geographic distribution and vaguely defined epidemiology of mers cov have created an urgent need for effective public health countermeasures paramount of which is an effective means of prevention through a vaccine or antibody prophylaxis despite the relatively few number of cases to date research and development of mers cov vaccine candidates is advancing quickly this review surveys the landscape of these efforts across multiple groups in academia government and industry

Text: human challenge studies to accelerate coronavirus vaccine licensure controlled human challenge trials of sars cov vaccine candidates could accelerate the testing and potential rollout of efficacious vaccines by replacing conventional phase testing of vaccine candidates such trials may subtract many months from the licensure process making efficacious vaccines available more quickly obviously challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death however we argue that such studies by accelerating vaccine evaluation could reduce the global burden of coronavirus related mortality and morbidity volunteers in such studies could autonomously authorize the risks to themselves and their net risk could be acceptable if participants comprise healthy young adults who are at relatively low risk of serious disease following natural infection if they have a high baseline risk of natural infection and if during the trial they receive frequent monitoring and following any infection the best available care

Text: advanced in silico tools for designing of antigenic epitope as potential vaccine candidates against coronavirus vaccines are the most economical and potent substitute of available medicines to cure various bacterial and viral diseases earlier killed or attenuated pathogens were employed for vaccine development but in present era the peptide vaccines are in much trend and are favoured over whole vaccines because of their superiority over conventional vaccines these vaccines are either based on single proteins or on synthetic peptides including several b cell and t cell epitopes however the overall mechanism of action remains the same and works by prompting the immune system to activate the specific b cell and t cell mediated responses against the pathogen rino rappuoli and others have contributed in this field by plotting the design of the most potent and fully computational approach for discovery of potential vaccine candidates which is popular as reverse vaccinology this is quite an unambiguous advance for vaccine evolution where one begins with the genome information of the pathogen and ends up with the list of certain epitopes after application of multiple bioinformatics tools this book chapter is an effort to bring this approach of reverse vaccinology into notice of readers using example of coronavirus
