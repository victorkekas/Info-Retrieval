Text: explore the possible impact of bcg vaccination policy on the morbidity mortality and recovery rates due to covid infection background the coronavirus disease covid is the new form of an acute infectious respiratory disease and has quickly spread over most continents in the world recently it has been shown that bacille calmette guerin bcg might protect against covid this study aims to investigate the possible correlation between bcg vaccination and morbidity mortality recovery rate associated with covid infection methods data of covid confirmed cases deaths recoveries and population were obtained from https www worldometers info coronavirus accessed on june to have meaningful comparisons among countries mortality and recovery rates we only choose those countries with covid infected cases at least the poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between bcg vaccination and morbidity mortality and recovery rates results among those countries with at least covid infected cases there were countries with bcg vaccination information available the adjusted rates ratio of covid confirmed cases for current bcg vaccination vs non current bcg vaccination was with ci moreover the adjusted odds ratio or of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for current bcg vaccination vs non current bcg vaccination were with ci and with ci respectively conclusions that data in this study show the bcg might provide the protection against covid with consequent less covid infection and deaths and more rapid recovery bcg vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease specific vaccine is developed but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials

Text: factors associated with recovery delay in a sample of patients diagnosed by mers cov rrt pcr a saudi arabian multicenter retrospective study background research evidence exists that poor prognosis is common in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov patients objectives this study estimates recovery delay intervals and identifies associated factors in a sample of saudi arabian patients admitted for suspected mers cov and diagnosed by rrt pcr assay methods a multicenter retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted between september and june and diagnosed by rrt pcr procedures to have mers cov and non mers cov infection in which achieved recovery detailed medical charts were reviewed for each patient who achieved recovery time intervals in days were calculated from presentation to the initial rrt pcr diagnosis diagnosis delay and from the initial rrt pcr diagnosis to recovery recovery delay results the median recovery delay in our sample was days according to the multivariate negative binomial model elderly age mers cov infection icu admission and abnormal radiology findings were associated with longer recovery delay adjusted relative risk arr and respectively camel contact and the presence of respiratory symptoms at presentation were associated with a shorter recovery delay expedited recovery arr and respectively diagnosis delay is a positive predictor for recovery delay r p conclusions the study evidence supports that longer recovery delay was seen in patients of older age mers cov infection icu admission and abnormal radiology findings shorter recovery delay was found in patients who had camel contact and respiratory symptoms at presentation these findings may help us understand clinical decision making on directing hospital resources toward prompt screening monitoring and implementing clinical recovery and treatment strategies
