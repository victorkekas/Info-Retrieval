Text: drug repurposing prediction for covid using probabilistic networks and crowdsourced curation severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two sars cov the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease covid pandemic represents an unprecedented global health challenge consequently a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame however developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic drug repurposing by contrast provides an attractive alternative as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements in this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs identifying drug repurposing opportunities for covid we demonstrate the value of this approach reporting on eight potential repurposing opportunities identified and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future studies

Text: a brief overview of current drug repurposing approaches for covid management this brief overview is intended to shed light on the current drug repositioning also called drug repurposing in the therapeutics of the novel coronavirus disease which emerged in covid in this sense the repositioning drugs for new indications can offer a better risk versus reward trade off when compared to other drug development strategies given that it makes use of drugs whose safety profile are already understood nonetheless this approach allows healthcare professionals to promptly tackle the disease by investigating readily available drugs against it

Text: computational studies of drug repurposing and synergism of lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir binding with sars cov protease against covid a novel coronavirus sars cov has caused a major outbreak in humans all over the world and it is the latest pandemic in the series of other infectious diseases the concept of drug repurposing has been used successfully for many years for known diseases considering the emergency and urgency drug repurposing concept is being explored for coronavirus disease covid as well recently the combination of three known drugs lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir has been proposed to control the virulence to a great extent in covid affected patients within hours hence we tried to understand the effect of synergism of these drugs against the sars cov protease using sequential docking studies as a result combination of three drugs showed a better binding energy than that of individual drugs further the complex was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to get insights into the stability of the complex considering the simultaneous interactions between three drugs and the protein the protein complexed with three drugs remained stable during the simulations hence these drugs can be explored further for drug repurposing against the successful inhibition of covid

Text: repurposing of miglustat to inhibit the coronavirus severe acquired respiratory syndrome sars cov repurposing clinically available drugs to treat the new coronavirus disease covid is an urgent need in these early stages of the sars cov pandemic when very few treatment options are available the iminosugar miglustat is a well characterized drug for the treatment of rare genetic lysosome storage diseases such as gaucher and niemann pick type c and has also been described to be active against a variety of enveloped viruses the activity of miglustat is here demonstrated for sars cov at concentrations achievable in the plasma by current clinical regimens without cytotoxicity the drug acts at the post entry level and leads to a marked decrease of viral proteins and release of infectious virus the mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity towards α glucosidases that are involved in early stages of glycoprotein n linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum leading to a marked decrease of the viral spike protein the wealth of available data on the clinical use of miglustat for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and the antiviral properties against sars cov make it an ideal candidate for drug repurposing
