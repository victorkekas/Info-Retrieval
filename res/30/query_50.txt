Text: preconditioning vaccine sites for mrna transfected dendritic cell therapy and antitumor efficacy messenger rna mrna transfected dendritic cell dc vaccines have been shown to be a powerful modality for eliciting antitumor immune responses in mice and humans however their application has not been fully optimized since many of the factors that contribute to their efficacy remain poorly understood work stemming from our laboratory has recently demonstrated that preconditioning the vaccine site with a recall antigen prior to the administration of a dendritic cell vaccine creates systemic recall responses and resultantly enhances dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes with improved antitumor efficacy this chapter describes the generation of murine mrna transfected dc vaccines as well as a method for vaccine site preconditioning with protein antigen formulations that create potent recall responses

Text: lineardesign efficient algorithms for optimized mrna sequence design a messenger rna mrna vaccine has emerged as a promising direction to combat the current covid pandemic this requires an mrna sequence that is stable and highly productive in protein expression features which have been shown to benefit from greater mrna secondary structure folding stability and optimal codon usage however sequence design remains a hard problem due to the exponentially many synonymous mrna sequences that encode the same protein we show that this design problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal language theory and computational linguistics that can be solved in o n time where n is the mrna sequence length this algorithm could still be too slow for large n e g n nucleotides for the spike protein of sars cov so we further developed a linear time approximate version lineardesign inspired by our recent work linearfold this algorithm lineardesign can compute the approximate minimum free energy mrna sequence for this spike protein in just minutes using beam size b with only loss in free energy change compared to exact search i e b infinity which costs hour we also develop two algorithms for incorporating the codon optimality into the design one based on k best parsing to find alternative sequences and one directly incorporating codon optimality into the dynamic programming our work provides efficient computational tools to speed up and improve mrna vaccine development
