Text: dissemination of mhv strain jhm infection does not require specific coronavirus receptors in this report we demonstrate the syncytial spread of mhv strain jhm infection through non murine cell cultures which lack a specific mhv receptor and are therefore resistant to infection by free virions this was achieved by allowing infected murine cells to settle onto confluent monolayers of non murine cells in a straightforward infectious center assay receptor independent syncytium formation induced by cells expressing the mhv spike s from recombinant vaccinia viruses vv indicated that spread was mediated by this coronavirus glycoprotein we conclude that the s protein of mhv is so potently fusogenic that it does not require prior binding to a virus specific surface receptor to induce fusion of closely opposed plasma membranes

Text: optimized lockdown strategies for curbing the spread of covid a south african case study to curb the spread of covid many governments around the world have implemented tiered lockdowns with varying degrees of stringency lockdown levels are typically increased when the disease spreads and reduced when the disease abates a predictive control approach is used to develop optimized lockdown strategies for curbing the spread of covid these strategies are then applied to south african data the south african case is of immediate interest as the number of confirmed infectious cases does not appear to have peaked yet at the time of writing while at the same time the south african government is busy reducing the degree of lockdown an epidemiological model for the spread of covid in south africa was previously developed and is used in conjunction with a hybrid model predictive controller to optimize lockdown management under different policy scenarios scenarios considered include how flatten the curve to a level that the healthcare system can cope with how to balance lives and livelihoods and what impact the compliance of the population to the lockdown measures has on the spread of covid

Text: covid learning from lessons to guide treatment and prevention interventions coronavirus disease covid is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and first emerged in december in wuhan hubei province china since then the virus has rapidly spread to many countries while the outbreak in china appears to be in decline the disease has spread across the world with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection related deaths here we highlight i the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of covid disease and ii an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent covid and potential future related pandemics although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza the rate does seem to vary from country to country possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients however no proven effective therapies for sars cov currently exist a number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of covid patients but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs either alone or in combination will prove effective there is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against covid but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available this review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the covid pandemic examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of covid and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine

Text: analysis on novel coronavirus covid using machine learning methods in this paper we are working on a pandemic of novel coronavirus covid covid is an infectious disease it creates severe damage in the lungs covid causes illness in humans and has killed many people in the entire world however this virus is reported as a pandemic by the world health organization who and all countries are trying to control and lockdown all places the main objective of this work is to solve the five different tasks such as i predicting the spread of coronavirus across regions ii analyzing the growth rates and the types of mitigation across countries iii predicting how the epidemic will end iv analyzing the transmission rate of the virus v correlating the coronavirus and weather conditions the advantage of doing these tasks to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation how well the mitigations are working how many cases have been prevented by this mitigations an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection with old medication understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to end we will be able to understand and analyze how fast or slow the virus is spreading among regions and the infected patient to reduce the spread based clear understanding of the correlation between the spread and weather conditions in this paper we propose a novel support vector regression method to analysis five different tasks related to novel coronavirus in this work instead of simple regression line we use the supported vectors also to get better classification accuracy our approach is evaluated and compared with other well known regression models on standard available datasets the promising results demonstrate its superiority in both efficiency and accuracy

Text: does genetic diversity limit disease spread in natural host populations it is a commonly held view that genetically homogenous host populations are more vulnerable to infection than genetically diverse populations the underlying idea known as the monoculture effect is well documented in agricultural studies low genetic diversity in the wild can result from bottlenecks that is founder effects biparental inbreeding or self fertilization any of which might increase the risk of epidemics host genetic diversity could buffer populations against epidemics in nature but it is not clear how much diversity is required to prevent disease spread recent theoretical and empirical studies particularly in daphnia populations have helped to establish that genetic diversity can reduce parasite transmission here we review the present theoretical work and empirical evidence and we suggest a new focus on finding diversity thresholds
