Text: development and validation of chest ct based imaging biomarkers for early stage covid screening coronavirus disease covid is currently a global pandemic and the early screening of covid is one of the key factors for covid control and treatment here we developed and validated chest ct based imaging biomarkers for covid patient screening we identified the vasculature like signals from ct images and found that compared to healthy and community acquired pneumonia cap patients the covid patients revealed significantly higher abundance of these signals furthermore unsupervised feature learning leads to the discovery of clinical relevant imaging biomarkers from the vasculature like signals for accurate and sensitive covid screening that has been double blindly validated in an independent hospital sensitivity specificity auc our findings could open a new avenue to assist screening of covid patients

Text: prognostic value of cardiovascular biomarkers in covid a review in early december the coronavirus disease covid caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov first emerged in wuhan china as of may th a total of over million covid cases and deaths have been reported globally reflecting the raised infectivity and severity of this virus amongst hospitalised covid patients there is a high prevalence of established cardiovascular disease cvd there is evidence showing that covid may exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors and preexisting cvd or may lead to cardiovascular complications with intensive care units operating at maximum capacity and such staggering mortality rates reported it is imperative during this time sensitive covid outbreak to identify patients with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and or myocardial injury preliminary findings from covid studies have shown the association of biomarkers of acute cardiac injury and coagulation with worse prognosis while these biomarkers are recognised for cvd there is emerging prospect that they may aid prognosis in covid especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors that predispose to worse outcomes consequently the aim of this review is to identify cardiovascular prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality in covid and to highlight considerations for incorporating laboratory testing of biomarkers of cardiovascular performance in covid to optimise outcomes

Text: biomarkers of sepsis time for a reappraisal introduction sepsis biomarkers can have important diagnostic therapeutic and prognostic functions in a previous review we identified references reporting on different biomarkers related to sepsis in the present review we evaluate the progress in the research of sepsis biomarkers methods using the same methodology as in our previous review we searched the pubmed database from until september using the terms biomarker and sepsis there were no restrictions by age or language and all studies clinical and experimental were included results we retrieved a total of new references since our previous review we identified biomarkers of which were new compared to our previous list the majority of biomarkers have been evaluated in fewer than studies with being assessed in just a single study apart from studies of c reactive protein crp or procalcitonin pct only biomarkers have been assessed in clinical studies with more than participants forty biomarkers have been compared to pct and or crp for their diagnostic value were shown to have a better diagnostic value for sepsis than either or both of these biomarkers forty four biomarkers have been evaluated for a role in answering a specific clinical question rather than for their general diagnostic or prognostic properties in sepsis conclusions the number of biomarkers being identified is still increasing although at a slower rate than in the past most of the biomarkers have not been well studied in particular the clinical role of these biomarkers needs to be better evaluated

Text: imaging biomarkers in acute ischemic stroke trials a systematic review background and purpose imaging biomarkers are increasingly used to provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke however this approach of routinely using imaging biomarkers to inform treatment decisions has yet to be translated into successful randomized trials the aim of this study was to systematically review the use of imaging biomarkers in randomized controlled trials in patients with acute ischemic stroke exploring the purposes for which the imaging biomarkers were used materials and methods we performed a systematic review of imaging biomarkers used in randomized controlled trials of acute ischemic stroke in which a therapeutic intervention was trialed within hours of symptom onset data bases searched included medline embase strokecenter org and the virtual international stroke trials archive results eighty four studies met the criteria of which used imaging to select patients for subgroup analysis and as an outcome measure imaging biomarkers were broadly used for purposes there was marked heterogeneity in the definitions and uses of imaging biomarkers and significant publication bias among post hoc analyses conclusions imaging biomarkers offer the opportunity to refine the trial cohort by minimizing participant variation to decrease sample size and to personalize treatment approaches for those who stand to benefit most however within imaging modalities there has been little consistency between stroke trials greater effort to prospectively use consistent imaging biomarkers should help improve the development of novel treatment strategies in acute stroke and improve comparison between studies
