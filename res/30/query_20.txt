Text: effects of angiotensin ii receptor blockers and ace angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on virus infection inflammatory status and clinical outcomes in patients with covid and hypertension a single center retrospective study with the capability of inducing elevated expression of ace angiotensin converting enzyme the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs or ace inhibitors treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation we aimed to evaluate the effects of arbs ace inhibitors on coronavirus disease covid in a retrospective single center study one hundred twenty six patients with covid and preexisting hypertension at hubei provincial hospital of traditional chinese medicine in wuhan from january to february were retrospectively allocated to arbs ace inhibitors group n and non arbs ace inhibitors group n according to their antihypertensive medication one hundred twenty five age and sex matched patients with covid without hypertension were randomly selected as nonhypertension controls in addition the medication history of patients with hypertension that were admitted to hubei provincial hospital of traditional chinese medicine from november to december before the covid outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison epidemiological demographic clinical and laboratory data were collected analyzed and compared between these groups the frequency of arbs ace inhibitors usage in patients with hypertension with or without covid were comparable among patients with covid and hypertension those received either arbs ace inhibitors or non arbs ace inhibitors had comparable blood pressure however arbs ace inhibitors group had significantly lower concentrations of hs crp high sensitivity c reactive protein p and pct procalcitonin p furthermore a lower proportion of critical patients versus p and a lower death rate versus p were observed in arbs ace inhibitors group than non arbs ace inhibitors group although these differences failed to reach statistical significance our findings thus support the use of arbs ace inhibitors in patients with covid and preexisting hypertension
