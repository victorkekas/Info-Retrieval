Text: structural basis of the potential binding mechanism of remdesivir to sars cov rna dependent rna polymerase image see text starting from late the coronavirus disease covid has emerged as a once in a century pandemic with deadly consequences which urgently calls for new treatments cures and supporting apparatuses recently because of its positive results in clinical trials remdesivir was approved by the food and drug administration to treat covid through emergency use authorization here we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target sars cov virus rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp we first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of sars cov nsp rdrp with a sequence identity of we then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir rdrp complex to the atp bound poliovirus rdrp without the rna template the putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations the resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the rna template when aligned with the newly solved cryo em structure of sars cov rdrp the relative binding free energy between remdesivir and atp was calculated to be kcal mol where remdesivir bound much stronger to sars cov rdrp than the natural substrate atp the fold improvement in the k d from remdesivir over atp indicates an effective replacement of atp in blocking of the rdrp preinsertion site key residues d s and r are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir these findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a sars cov rna chain terminator effectively stopping its rna replication with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and or drug resistance studies
