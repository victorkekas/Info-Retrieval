Text: human challenge studies to accelerate coronavirus vaccine licensure controlled human challenge trials of sars cov vaccine candidates could accelerate the testing and potential rollout of efficacious vaccines by replacing conventional phase testing of vaccine candidates such trials may subtract many months from the licensure process making efficacious vaccines available more quickly obviously challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death however we argue that such studies by accelerating vaccine evaluation could reduce the global burden of coronavirus related mortality and morbidity volunteers in such studies could autonomously authorize the risks to themselves and their net risk could be acceptable if participants comprise healthy young adults who are at relatively low risk of serious disease following natural infection if they have a high baseline risk of natural infection and if during the trial they receive frequent monitoring and following any infection the best available care

Text: advanced in silico tools for designing of antigenic epitope as potential vaccine candidates against coronavirus vaccines are the most economical and potent substitute of available medicines to cure various bacterial and viral diseases earlier killed or attenuated pathogens were employed for vaccine development but in present era the peptide vaccines are in much trend and are favoured over whole vaccines because of their superiority over conventional vaccines these vaccines are either based on single proteins or on synthetic peptides including several b cell and t cell epitopes however the overall mechanism of action remains the same and works by prompting the immune system to activate the specific b cell and t cell mediated responses against the pathogen rino rappuoli and others have contributed in this field by plotting the design of the most potent and fully computational approach for discovery of potential vaccine candidates which is popular as reverse vaccinology this is quite an unambiguous advance for vaccine evolution where one begins with the genome information of the pathogen and ends up with the list of certain epitopes after application of multiple bioinformatics tools this book chapter is an effort to bring this approach of reverse vaccinology into notice of readers using example of coronavirus

Text: biodistribution of dna plasmid vaccines against hiv ebola severe acute respiratory syndrome or west nile virus is similar without integration despite differing plasmid backbones or gene inserts the vaccine research center has developed a number of vaccine candidates for different diseases infectious agents hiv severe acute respiratory syndrome virus west nile virus and ebola virus plus a plasmid cytokine adjuvant il ig based on a dna plasmid vaccine platform to support the clinical development of each of these vaccine candidates preclinical studies have been performed in mice or rabbits to determine where in the body these plasmid vaccines would biodistribute and how rapidly they would clear in the course of these studies it has been observed that regardless of the gene insert expressing the vaccine immunogen or cytokine adjuvant and regardless of the promoter used to drive expression of the gene insert in the plasmid backbone the plasmid vaccines do not biodistribute widely and remain essentially in the site of injection in the muscle and overlying subcutis even though molecules are inoculated in the studies in rabbits by day or week postinoculation already all but on the order of molecules per microgram of dna extracted from tissue have been cleared at the injection site over the course of months the plasmid clears from the site of injection with only a small percentage of animals generally retaining a small number of copies generally around copies in the muscle at the injection site this pattern of biodistribution confined to the injection site and clearance within months is consistent regardless of differences in the promoter in the plasmid backbone or differences in the gene insert being expressed by the plasmid vaccine in addition integration has not been observed with plasmid vaccine candidates inoculated i m by biojector or by needle and syringe these data build on the repeated dose toxicology studies performed see companion article sheets et al to demonstrate the safety and suitability for investigational human use of dna plasmid vaccine candidates for a variety of infectious disease prevention indications

Text: short peptide vaccine design and development promises and challenges vaccine development for viral diseases is a challenge where subunit vaccines are often ineffective therefore the need for alternative solutions is crucial thus short peptide vaccine candidates promise effective answers under such circumstances short peptide vaccine candidates are linear t cell epitopes antigenic determinants that are recognized by the immune system that specifically function by binding human leukocyte antigen hla alleles of different ethnicities including black caucasian oriental hispanic pacific islander american indian australian aboriginal and mixed ethnicities the population specific allele level hla sequence data in the public imgt hla database contains approximately nomenclature defined class i and class ii hla alleles as of march present in several ethnic populations the bottleneck in short peptide vaccine design and development is hla polymorphism on the one hand and viral diversity on the other hand hence a crucial step in its design and development is hla allele specific binding of short antigen peptides this is usually combinatorial and computationally labor intensive mathematical models utilizing structure defined pockets are currently available for class i and class ii hla peptide binding peptides frameworks have been developed to design protocols to identify the most feasible short peptide cocktails as vaccine candidates with superantigen properties among known hla supertypes this approach is a promising solution to develop new viral vaccines given the current advancement in t cell immuno informatics yet challenging in terms of prediction efficiency and protocol development

Text: vaccines against coronaviruses the state of the art the emerging epidemic caused by the new coronavirus sars cov represents the most important socio health threat of the st century the high contagiousness of the virus the strong impact on the health system of the various countries and the absence to date of treatments able to improve the prognosis of the disease make the introduction of a vaccine indispensable even though there are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines the aim of the study is to carry out a review of the medical literature concerning vaccine candidates for the main coronaviruses responsible for human epidemics including recent advances in the development of a vaccine against covid this extensive review carried out on the vaccine candidates of the main epidemic coronaviruses of the past has shown that the studies in animal models suggest a high efficacy of potential vaccines in providing protection against viral challenges similar human studies have not yet been carried out as the main trials are aimed at assessing mainly vaccine safety and immunogenicity whereas the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov epidemic ended almost two decades ago and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov epidemic is now better controlled as it is less contagious due to the high lethality of the virus the current sars cov pandemic represents a problem that is certainly more compelling which pushes us to accelerate the studies not only for the production of vaccines but also for innovative pharmacological treatments sars cov vaccines might come too late to affect the first wave of this pandemic but they might be useful if additional subsequent waves occur or in a post pandemic perspective in which the virus continues to circulate as a seasonal virus

Text: anti severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike antibodies trigger infection of human immune cells via a ph and cysteine protease independent fcγr pathway public health measures successfully contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov infection however the precursor of the sars cov remains in its natural bat reservoir and reemergence of a human adapted sars like coronavirus remains a plausible public health concern vaccination is a major strategy for containing resurgence of sars in humans and a number of vaccine candidates have been tested in experimental animal models we previously reported that antibody elicited by a sars cov vaccine candidate based on recombinant full length spike protein trimers potentiated infection of human b cell lines despite eliciting in vivo a neutralizing and protective immune response in rodents these observations prompted us to investigate the mechanisms underlying antibody dependent enhancement ade of sars cov infection in vitro we demonstrate here that anti spike immune serum while inhibiting viral entry in a permissive cell line potentiated infection of immune cells by sars cov spike pseudotyped lentiviral particles as well as replication competent sars coronavirus antibody mediated infection was dependent on fcγ receptor ii but did not use the endosomal lysosomal pathway utilized by angiotensin i converting enzyme ace the accepted receptor for sars cov this suggests that ade of sars cov utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism into immune cells different sars vaccine candidates elicit sera that differ in their capacity to induce ade in immune cells despite their comparable potency to neutralize infection in ace bearing cells our results suggest a novel mechanism by which sars cov can enter target cells and illustrate the potential pitfalls associated with immunization against it these findings should prompt further investigations into sars pathogenesis
