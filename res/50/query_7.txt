Text: covid serological tests how well do they actually perform in only a few months after initial discovery in wuhan china sars cov and the associated coronavirus disease covid have become a global pandemic causing significant mortality and morbidity and implementation of strict isolation measures in the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutics reliable serological testing must be a key element of public health policy to control further spread of the disease and gradually remove quarantine measures serological diagnostic tests are being increasingly used to provide a broader understanding of covid incidence and to assess immunity status in the population however there are discrepancies between claimed and actual performance data for serological diagnostic tests on the market in this study we conducted a review of independent studies evaluating the performance of sars cov serological tests we found significant variability in the accuracy of marketed tests and highlight several lab based and point of care rapid serological tests with high levels of performance the findings of this review highlight the need for ongoing independent evaluations of commercialized covid diagnostic tests

Text: estimating seroprevalence with imperfect serological tests exploiting cutoff free approaches large scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current coronavirus pandemic serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and define cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero positives and negatives with the imperfect tests that are currently available to test for past sars cov infection the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of seroprevalence and is usually corrected post hoc to account for the sensitivity and specificity here we use a likelihood based inference method previously called mixture models for the estimation of the seroprevalence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure we confirm that this likelihood based method outperforms the methods based on cutoffs and post hoc corrections leading to less variation in point estimates of the seroprevalence and its temporal trend we illustrate how the likelihood based method can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests we also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test s ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the seroprevalence lastly we show how this approach can be used to identify classes of case sera with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures that have not been used for test validation an r package with the likelihood and power analysis functions is provided our study advocates to using serological tests without cutoffs especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals this approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff based methods with post hoc correction at exactly the low seroprevalence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in covid serosurveys author summary as other pathogens sars cov elicits antibody responses in infected people that can be detected in their blood serum as early as a week after the infection until long after recovery the presence of sars cov specific antibodies can therefore be used as a marker of past infection and the prevalence of seropositive people i e people with specific antibodies is a key measure to determine the extent of the coronavirus pandemic the serological tests however are usually not perfect yielding false positive and negative results here we exploit an approach that refrains from classifying people as seropositive or negative but rather compares the antibody level to that of confirmed cases and controls this approach leads to more reliable seroprevalence estimates especially for the low prevalence and low test accuracies that we face during the current coronavirus pandemic we also show how this approach can be extended to infer the presence of cases that have not been used for validating the test such as people that underwent a mild or even asymptomatic infection

Text: meta analysis of diagnostic performance of serological tests for sars cov antibodies and public health implications serology based tests have become a key public health element in the covid pandemic to assess the degree of herd immunity that has been achieved in the population these tests differ between one another in several ways here we conducted a systematic review and meta analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of currently available sars cov serological tests and assessed their real world performance under scenarios of varying proportion of infected individuals we included independent studies that specified the antigen used for antibody detection and used quantitative methods we identified nine independent studies of which six were based on commercial elisa or cmia clia assays and three on in house tests test sensitivity ranged from to for igm from to for igg and from to for total antibodies random effects models yielded a summary sensitivity of ci for igm and for both igg ci and total antibodies ci specificity was very high for most tests and its pooled estimate was ci for igm and ci for both igg and total antibodies the heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity across tests was generally high i in populations with a low prevalence of seroconverted individuals the positive predictive value would be for most assays except those reporting perfect specificity our data suggest that the use of serological tests for large scale prevalence surveys or to grant immunity passports are currently only justified in hard hit regions while they should be used with caution elsewhere

Text: testing for sars cov the day the world turned its attention to the clinical laboratory in the last few months an unprecedented number of laboratory tests for coronavirus disease covid have been developed at a remarkable speed with the rapid adoption of these tests into clinical practice combined with the widespread publicity they received questions arose related to the different types of tests their utility performance and regulatory approval status the aim of this publication is to provide a general landscape of laboratory testing for covid and offer a historical and regulatory perspective associated with them specifically we aim to elaborate on the regulatory complexities of diagnostic testing in the united states and its implications to the present outbreak as well as provide a synopsis of laboratory tests that have been developed for covid we will first address the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus directly by either nucleic acid amplification tests or by the detection of the viral protein for active infections subsequently we will provide an overview of serological tests that can aid not only in diagnosis but additionally help to identify prior infections and potential immunity

Text: reliability of serological tests for covid comparison of three immunochromatography test kits for sars cov antibodies background several immunochromatographic serological test kits have been developed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov specific antibodies but their relative performance and potential clinical utility is unclear methods three commercially available serological test kits were evaluated using serum samples collected from patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease covid results the igm antibody positive rates of the three serological test kits for samples taken at the early stage of the disease days after onset were and respectively the igm antibody positive rates over the entire period were and respectively the igg antibody positive rates for samples taken after days of onset were and respectively conclusion there were large differences among the results of the three test kits only few cases showed positive results for igm in the early stage of disease and the igm antibody positive rates over the entire period were low suggesting that the kits used in this study were unsuitable for diagnosis of covid the igg antibody was positive in almost all samples after days of onset suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past
