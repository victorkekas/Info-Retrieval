Text: the angiotensin converting enzyme ace receptor in the prevention and treatment of covid are distinctly different paradigms there is current debate concerning the use of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii type receptor blockers arbs for hypertension management during covid infection specifically the suggestion has been made that ace inhibitors or arbs could theoretically contribute to infection via increasing ace receptor expression and hence increase viral load the ace receptor is responsible for binding the sar cov viral spike and causing covid infection what makes the argument somewhat obtuse for ace inhibitors or arbs is that ace receptor expression can be increased by compounds that activate or increase the expression of sirt henceforth common dietary interventions vitamins and nutrients may directly or indirectly influence the cellular expression of the ace receptor there are many common compounds that can increase the expression of the ace receptor including vitamin c metformin resveratrol vitamin b and vitamin d it is important to acknowledge that down regulation or blocking the cellular ace receptor will likely be pro inflammatory and may contribute to end organ pathology and mortality in covid in conclusion from the perspective of the ace receptor covid prevention and treatment are distinctly different this letter reflects on this current debate and suggests angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and arbs are likely beneficial during covid infection for hypertensive and normotensive patients

Text: should angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ever be used for the management of hypertension purpose of review angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are commonly used anti hypertensive medications in a number of clinical settings they are often used interchangeably but we pose the provocative question as to whether they should be we review the literature to evaluate for any differences in efficacy between the two classes in order to determine if the greater side effects associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are offset by any advantageous effects on outcomes to warrant their use over angiotensin receptor blockers recent findings in many clinical scenarios the data supports similar efficacy between ace inhibitors and arbs while in a minority of others there are murky signals from previous trials that suggest ace inhibitors may be better however when reviewing the literature in its entirety and taking into account recently published pooled analysis and head to head trials it is reasonable to conclude that ace inhibitors and arbs have similar efficacy this is in contrast to data on adverse effects which consistently favors the use of arbs summary from the available data it is reasonable to conclude that ace inhibitors and arbs have equal efficacy yet unequal adverse effects it is in this context that we take the provocative stance that ace inhibitors should not be used to treat hypertension

Text: covid medication comet study protocol for a cohort study various theories about drugs such as ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs in relation to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and clinical outcomes of covid are circulating in both mainstream media and medical literature these are based on the fact that ace facilitates sars cov cell invasion via binding of a viral spike protein to ace however the effect of ace inhibitors arbs and other drugs on ace is unclear and all theories are based on conflicting evidence mainly from animal studies therefore clinical evidence is urgently needed the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between use of these drugs on clinical outcome of patients with covid patients will be included from several hospitals in europe data will be collected in a user friendly database digitalis on an external server analyses will be adjusted for sex age and presence of cardiovascular disease hypertension and diabetes these results will enable more rational choices for randomised controlled trials for preventive and therapeutic strategies in covid

Text: structure and function of angiotensin converting enzyme and its inhibitors abstract angiotensin converting enzyme ace ec is a membrane bound zinc dependent dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin i to the potent vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin ii by removing the two c terminal amino acids ace is well known to be a key part of the rennin angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure the inhibitors of ace have the potency of treating hypertension this article reviews the structure function relationship of ace as well as its gene polymorphism and inhibitor development in particular it has been found that the catalytic mechanisms of the two active sites of somatic ace in the cleavage of angiotensin i and bradykin are different therefore by specifically targeting the individual active sites of somatic ace it will likely offer a new way to develop novel ace inhibitors with fewer side effects

Text: treatment with ace inhibitors is associated with less severe disease with sars covid infection in a multi site uk acute hospital trust abstract background the sars cov virus binds to the ace receptor for cell entry it has been suggested that ace inhibitors which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and which raise ace levels may increase the risk of severe covid infection methods we evaluated this hypothesis in an early cohort of acute inpatients with covid at king s college hospital and princess royal university hospital london uk with the primary endpoint being death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within days of symptom onset findings patients out of patients reached the primary endpoint contrary to the hypothesis treatment with ace inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of rapidly deteriorating severe disease there was a lower rate of death or transfer to a critical care unit within days in patients on an ace inhibitor or ci p adjusting for age gender comorbidities hypertension diabetes mellitus ischaemic heart disease and heart failure interpretation although a small sample size we do not see evidence for ace inhibitors increasing the short term severity of covid disease and patients on treatment with ace inhibitors should continue these drugs during their covid illness a potential beneficial effect needs to be explored as more data becomes available

Text: a hypothesis for pathobiology and treatment of covid the centrality of ace ace imbalance angiotensin converting enzyme ace is the receptor for the coronavirus sars cov which causes covid we propose the following hypothesis imbalance in the action of ace and ace derived peptides thereby enhancing angiotensin ii ang ii signaling a primary driver of covid pathobiology ace ace imbalance occurs due to the binding of sars cov to ace reducing ace mediated conversion of ang ii to ang peptides that counteract pathophysiological effects of ace generated angii this hypothesis suggests several approaches to treat covid by restoring ace ace balance ang ii receptor blockers arbs ace inhibitors aceis agonists of receptors activated by ace derived peptides e g ang which activates mas recombinant human ace or ace peptides as decoys for the virus reducing ace ace imbalance is predicted to blunt covid associated morbidity and mortality especially in vulnerable patients importantly approved arbs and aceis can be rapidly repurposed to test their efficacy in treating covid

Text: management of hypertension in covid the ace receptor plays a central role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus host cell entry and propagation it has therefore been postulated that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may upregulate ace expression and thus increase susceptibility to infection we suggest that alternative anti hypertensive agents should be preferred among individuals who may be exposed to this increasingly common and potentially lethal virus

Text: susceptibility to sars coronavirus s protein driven infection correlates with expression of angiotensin converting enzyme and infection can be blocked by soluble receptor abstract the angiotensin converting enzyme ace has been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus sars cov here we show that ace expression on cell lines correlates with susceptibility to sars cov s driven infection suggesting that ace is a major receptor for sars cov the soluble ectodomain of ace specifically abrogated s mediated infection and might therefore be exploited for the generation of inhibitors deletion of a major portion of the cytoplasmic domain of ace had no effect on s driven infection indicating that this domain is not important for receptor function our results point to a central role of ace in sars cov infection and suggest a minor contribution of the cytoplasmic domain to receptor function
