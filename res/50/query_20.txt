Text: rethinking the renin angiotensin system and its role in cardiovascular regulation angiotensin converting enzyme ace plays a pivotal role in the renin angiotensin system ras and ace inhibitors are widely used in several clinical conditions including hypertension and heart failure recently a homologue of ace ace has been discovered both ace and ace are emerging as key enzymes of the ras where ace may play a role as negative regulator of ace moreover ace appears to be an important enzyme outside the classical ras as it hydrolyzes apelins dynorphin a des arg bradykinin and other peptide substrates the precise interplay between tissue ace ace and their substrates and by products are presently still unclear ace inhibitors reduce angiotensin ii formation and bradykinin degradation but do not inhibit ace activity moreover ace inhibitors differ in their affinity for tissue ace and it has been suggested that tissue ace affinity might be responsible for some of the beneficial properties of these drugs ace inhibitors also increase nitric oxide availability and activate several kinases that may regulate protein synthesis by interacting with the nucleus of the cells outside in signaling the outside in signaling may also be activated by bradykinin itself although the precise significance of the outside in signaling is still unclear this new role of ace inhibitors may represent a discriminant factor versus angiotensin ii receptors antagonists this mini review will summarize some new aspects concerning the recently discovered biological functions of ras and in particular of ace ace and ace inhibitors in cardiovascular system
