Text: clinical disease in children associated with newly described coronavirus subtypes objectives coronaviruses cause upper respiratory illness and occasionally lower tract disease in susceptible populations in this study we examined the prevalence of human coronaviruses including subtypes oc e and the recently described nl and hku in a pediatric population presenting to a children s hospital patients and methods specimens collected over a year period from pediatric patients presenting with acute respiratory illness were analyzed for the presence of coronavirus subtypes using consensus and subtype specific real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with coronavirus infection were examined retrospectively results coronaviruses were detected in of children eight and specimens were positive for subtypes e nl oc and hku respectively coronaviruses were detected throughout the study period all of the subtypes were present simultaneously in december the acute clinical features were similar across subtypes of children infected with a coronavirus as the sole respiratory pathogen had lower respiratory tract disease children whose only detectable respiratory virus was a coronavirus were more likely to have underlying chronic disease than were children coinfected with another respiratory virus conclusions although subtypes of coronavirus were detected the recently discovered coronavirus subtypes nl and hku accounted for the majority of coronaviruses detected in our cohort of mostly hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms new subtypes likely represent a substantial portion of previously unexplained respiratory illnesses

Text: a comparison of ampv subtypes a and b full genomes gene transcripts and proteins led to reverse genetics systems rescuing both subtypes avian metapneumovirus ampv infection of poultry causes serious disease in most countries and subtype a reverse genetic rg systems have allowed a generation of viruses of known sequence and proved useful in developments towards better control by live vaccines while subtype b viruses are more prevalent bacterial cloning issues made subtype b rg systems difficult to establish a molecular comparison of subtype a and b viruses was undertaken to assess whether subtype a rg components could be partially or fully substituted ampv subtype a and b gene end sequences leading to polyadenylation are to our knowledge reported for the first time as well as several leader and trailer sequences after comparing these alongside previously reported gene starts and protein sequences it was concluded that subtype b genome copies would be most likely rescued by a subtype a support system and this assertion was supported when individual subtype a components were successfully substituted application of an advanced cloning plasmid permitted eventual completion of a fully subtype b rg system and proved that all subtype specific components could be freely exchanged between a and b systems

Text: sfj an implementation of semantic featherweight java there are two approaches to defining subtyping relations the syntactic and the semantic approach in semantic subtyping one defines a model of the language and an interpretation of types as subsets of this model subtyping is defined as inclusion of subsets denoting types an orthogonal subtyping question typical of object oriented languages is the nominal versus the structural subtyping dardha et al defined boolean types and semantic subtyping for featherweight java fj and integrated both nominal and structural subtyping thus exploiting the benefits of both approaches however these benefits were illustrated only at a theoretical level but not exploited practically we present sfj semantic featherweight java an implementation of fj which features boolean types semantic subtyping and integrates nominal as well as structural subtyping the benefits of sfj illustrated in the paper and the accompanying video with audio subtitles show how static type checking of boolean types and semantic subtyping gives higher guarantees of program correctness more flexibility and compactness of program writing

Text: australian infectious bronchitis viruses identification of nine subtypes by a neutralisation test the antigenic relationships between australian infectious bronchitis viruses including six vaccine viruses were studied by a neutralisation test using a plaque reduction method in chick embryo kidney cell monolayers the viruses formed nine distinct subtypes antiserum to each subtype had a high titre to viruses of the same subtype and a lower litre to viruses of different subtypes the heterologous titres of sera varied widely

Text: genotypes and subtypes of cryptosporidium spp in neonatal calves in northern ireland cryptosporidium spp in diarrheic calves less than days old from farms across northern ireland were examined over a year period by microscopic genotyping and subtyping techniques to characterize the transmission dynamics cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in of animals the prevalence rates of rotavirus coronavirus and escherichia coli k were lower as seen in of and of animals respectively of the cryptosporidium positive specimens available for molecular analysis cryptosporidium parvum was identified in specimens cryptosporidium bovis in eight and cryptosporidium deer like genotype in three sequence analysis of the kda glycoprotein gene identified iia subtypes and a new subtype family with of the positive specimens having the subtype iiaa g r eight of the iia subtypes were previously seen in humans in northern ireland several subtypes were temporally or geographically unique the genetic diversity in calves in northern ireland was much greater than that reported from other areas this work demonstrates the utility of genotyping and subtyping tools in characterizing the transmission of cryptosporidium spp in calves and humans

Text: in vitro subtype specific modulation of hiv trans activator of transcription tat on rnai silencing suppressor activity and cell death human immunodeficiency virus hiv is a global health concern affecting millions of individuals with a wide variety of currently circulating subtypes affecting various regions of the globe hiv relies on multiple regulatory proteins to modify the host cell to promote replication in infected t cells and these regulatory proteins can have subtle phenotypic differences between subtypes one of these proteins hiv trans activator of transcription tat is capable of rna interference rnai silencing suppressor rss activity and induction of cell death in t cells however the subtype specific rss activity and induction of cell death have not been explored we investigated the ability of tat subtypes and variants to induce rss activity and cell death tatb from hiv subtype b was found to be a potent rss activator by whereas tatc from hiv subtype c showed rss activity while subtype tatc variants exhibited varying levels a high level of cell death was induced by subtype tatb when compared to subtype tatc and varying levels were observed with subtype tatc variants these differential activities could be due to variations in the functional domains of tat these observations further our understanding of subtype specific augmentation of tat in hiv replication and pathogenesis
