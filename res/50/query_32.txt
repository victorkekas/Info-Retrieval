Text: the global population of sars cov is composed of six major subtypes the world health organization characterized the covid as a pandemic in march the second pandemic of the st century severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov is a positive stranded rna betacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae expanding virus populations as that of sars cov accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods in this context approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the sars cov population are necessary for a robust clustering here we proposed the subdivision of the global sars cov population into sixteen well defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural nsp nsp nsp nsp nsp and nsp cistrons structural spike and nucleocapsid and accessory orf genes six virus subtypes were predominant in the population but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications we hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the sars cov diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world a typical founder effect the genetic structure determined for the sars cov population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs

Text: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus elicits a weak interferon response compared to traditional interferon inducing viruses the aim of the present study is to investigate changes of interferon ifn production occurring over the first h after infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus cov and to compare these changes to those induced by well established ifn inducing viruses such as vesicular stomatitis vsv and newcastle viruses ndv experiments have been carried out using pbmcs of different healthy donors the results showed that the antiviral activity of ifn contained in the supernatant of sars cov infected pbmcs was lower than those induced by vsv and ndv consequently sars cov induces a lower synthesis of ifn α β and γ compared to vsv and ndv characterization of the profile of ifn α subtypes genes expression in sars cov infected pbmcs demonstrated that the level of ifn α and subtypes were higher compared to other ifn α subtypes namely ifn α and in conclusion sars cov induces ifns to a less extent compared to vsv and ndv thus suggesting that the ifn system does play a limited role in early host defense against sars cov infection
