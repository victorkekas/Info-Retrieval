Text: development of a quantitative assay for sars coronavirus and correlation of gapdh mrna with sars coronavirus in clinical specimens aims to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction q rt pcr for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov detection and explore the potential of using glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh mrna as an internal control to exclude false negative results methods sars cov and gapdh mrna were both measured in specimens from patients with sars follow up specimens from the same batch of patients and appropriate control subjects the relation between sars positivity and gapdh mrna concentration was investigated using the chi test increasing the sensitivity for sars cov and gapdh mrna detection was investigated in follow up specimens in which sars cov and gapdh mrna were not detected initially results varying amounts of sars cov were found in the sars cov positive specimens and sars cov was not detected in the follow up specimens and controls in addition concentrations of gapdh mrna were significantly different between the patients with sars follow up specimens and healthy controls kruskal wallis test p moreover gapdh mrna concentrations were highly correlated with sars cov positivity chi p finally sars cov and gapdh mrna were both detected in three follow up urine specimens that were initially negative when the amount of cdna used was increased from microl to and microl conclusions this q rt pcr assay can be used to detect sars cov moreover gapdh mrna may be useful to rule out false negative results in sars cov detection and the current extraction method for urine may not be sensitive enough to detect low titres of sars cov

Text: addressing covid drug development with artificial intelligence the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov the virus that led to the covid coronavirus disease pandemic has resulted in substantial overburdening of healthcare systems as well as an economic crisis on a global scale this has in turn resulted in widespread efforts to identify suitable therapies to address this aggressive pathogen therapeutic antibody and vaccine development are being actively explored and a phase i clinical trial of mrna which is developed in collaboration between the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and moderna inc is currently underway timelines for the broad deployment of a vaccine and antibody therapies have been estimated to be months or longer these are promising approaches that may lead to sustained efficacy in treating covid however its emergence has also led to a large number of clinical trials evaluating drug combinations composed of repurposed therapies as study results of these combinations continue to be evaluated there is a need to move beyond traditional drug screening and repurposing by harnessing artificial intelligence ai to optimize combination therapy design this may lead to the rapid identification of regimens that mediate unexpected and markedly enhanced treatment outcomes

Text: regulation of coronavirus rna transcription is likely mediated by protein rna interactions coronavirus mrna transcription was thought to be regulated by the interaction between the leader rna and the intergenic ig sequence probably involving direct rna rna interactions between complementary sequences in this study we found that a nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the leader rna up regulated mrna transcription and that a particular strain of mouse hepatitis virus mhv lacking this nucleotide transcribed subgenomic mrna species containing unusually heterogeneous leader fusion sites these results suggest that the sequence complementarity between the leader and ig is not necessarily required for mrna transcription uv cross linking experiments using cytoplasmic extracts of uninfected cells and the ig sequence showed that three different cellular proteins bound to ig of the template rna deletion analyses and site directed mutagenesis of ig further demonstrated a correlation between protein binding and transcription efficiency suggesting that these rna binding proteins are involved in the regulation of coronavirus mrna transcription we propose that coronavirus transcription is regulated by rna protein and protein protein interactions

Text: characterization of the african swine fever virus decapping enzyme during infection african swine fever virus asfv infection is characterized by a progressive decrease in cellular protein synthesis with a concomitant increase in viral protein synthesis though the mechanism by which the virus achieves this is still unknown decrease of cellular mrna is observed during asfv infection suggesting that inhibition of cellular proteins is due to an active mrna degradation process asfv carries a gene ba v d r malawi g r that encodes a decapping protein asfv dp that has a nudix hydrolase motif and decapping activity in vitro here we show that asfv dp was expressed from early times and accumulated throughout the infection with a subcellular localization typical of the endoplasmic reticulum colocalizing with the cap structure and interacting with the ribosomal protein l a asfv dp was capable of interaction with poly a rna in cultured cells primarily mediated by the n terminal region of the protein asfv dp also interacted with viral and cellular rnas in the context of infection and its overexpression in infected cells resulted in decreased levels of both types of transcripts this study points to asfv dp as a viral decapping enzyme involved in both the degradation of cellular mrna and the regulation of viral transcripts importance virulent asfv strains cause a highly infectious and lethal disease in domestic pigs for which there is no vaccine since an outbreak in the caucasus region has spread to russia jeopardizing the european pig population and making it essential to deepen knowledge about the virus here we demonstrate that asfv dp is a novel rna binding protein implicated in the regulation of mrna metabolism during infection making it a good target for vaccine development

Text: cooperation of an rna packaging signal and a viral envelope protein in coronavirus rna packaging murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv produces a genome length mrna mrna and six or seven species of subgenomic mrnas in infected cells among these mrnas only mrna is efficiently packaged into mhv particles mhv n protein binds to all mhv mrnas whereas envelope m protein interacts only with mrna this m protein mrna interaction most probably determines the selective packaging of mrna into mhv particles a short cis acting mhv rna packaging signal is necessary and sufficient for packaging rna into mhv particles the present study tested the possibility that the selective m protein mrna interaction is due to the packaging signal in mrna regardless of the presence or absence of the packaging signal n protein bound to mhv defective interfering rnas and intracellularly expressed non mhv rna transcripts to form ribonucleoprotein complexes m protein however interacted selectively with rnas containing the packaging signal moreover only the rna that interacted selectively with m protein was efficiently packaged into mhv particles thus it was the packaging signal that mediated the selective interaction between m protein and viral rna to drive the specific packaging of rna into virus particles this is the first example for any rna virus in which a viral envelope protein and a known viral rna packaging signal have been shown to determine the specificity and selectivity of rna packaging into virions

Text: bovine coronavirus mrna replication continues throughout persistent infection in cell culture the existence of viral mrna replicons was demonstrated in cells infected with the bovine coronavirus by showing a minus strand counterpart and a corresponding replicative intermediate for each subgenomic mrna species mrna replication is thus a universal property of coronaviruses since this is now the third coronavirus for which it has been demonstrated during the acute phase of infection first h minus and plus strands accumulated at the same rate initially but maximal accumulation of minus strands peaked earlier than that for plus strands indicating that minus and plus strand levels are differentially regulated in addition packaged input mrnas appeared to serve as templates for their own early replication mrna replication continued throughout establishment and maintenance of persistent infection studied for days which is consistent with our hypothesis that mrna replication contributes mechanistically to virus persistence a replication defective potentially interfering species of rna existed transiently beginning at day and ending before day postinfection but because of its transient nature it cannot be considered essential to the long term maintenance of virus persistence
