Text: eicosanoids the overlooked storm in covid severe coronavirus covid symptoms including systemic inflammatory response and multi system organ failure are now affecting thousands of infected patients and causing widespread mortality coronavirus infection causes tissue damage which triggers the endoplasmic reticulum er stress response and subsequent eicosanoid and cytokine storms while pro inflammatory eicosanoids including prostaglandins thromboxanes and leukotrienes are critical mediators of physiological processes such as inflammation fever allergy and pain their role in covid are poorly characterized arachidonic acid derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids eets could alleviate the systemic hyper inflammatory response in covid infection by modulating er stress and stimulating the resolution of inflammation soluble epoxide hydrolase seh inhibitors which increase endogenous eet levels exhibit potent anti inflammatory activity and inhibit various pathologic processes in preclinical disease models including pulmonary fibrosis thrombosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome therefore targeting eicosanoids and seh could be a novel therapeutic approach in combating covid in this review we discuss the predominant role of eicosanoids in regulating the inflammatory cascade and propose the potential application of seh inhibitors in alleviating covid symptoms we also discuss the host protective action of omega fatty acid derived epoxyeicosanoids and specialized pro resolving mediators spms in regulating anti inflammation and anti viral response future studies determining the eicosanoid profile in covid patient or preclinical model are pivotal in providing the novel insight of coronavirus host interaction and inflammation modulation

Text: models of cytokine dynamics in the inflammatory response of viral zoonotic infectious diseases inflammatory responses to an infection from a zoonotic pathogen such as avian influenza viruses hantaviruses and some coronaviruses are distinctly different in their natural reservoir versus human host while not as well studied in the natural reservoirs the pro inflammatory response and viral replication appear controlled and show no obvious pathology in contrast infection in humans results in an initial high viral load marked by an aggressive pro inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm the key difference in the course of the infection between the reservoir and human host is the inflammatory response in this investigation we apply a simple two component differential equation model for pro inflammatory and anti inflammatory responses and a detailed mathematical analysis to identify specific regions in parameter space for single stable endemic equilibrium bistability or periodic solutions the extensions of the deterministic model to two stochastic models account for variability in responses seen at the cell local or tissue global levels numerical solutions of the stochastic models exhibit outcomes that are typical of a chronic infection in the natural reservoir or a cytokine storm in human infection in the chronic infection occasional flare ups between high and low responses occur when model parameters are in a region of bistability or periodic solutions the cytokine storm with a vigorous pro inflammatory response and less vigorous anti inflammatory response occurs in the parameter region for a single stable endemic equilibrium with a strong pro inflammatory response the results of the model analyses and the simulations are interpreted in terms of the functional role of the cytokines and the inflammatory responses seen in infection of the natural reservoir or of the human host

Text: inflammation resolution a dual pronged approach to averting cytokine storms in covid severe coronavirus disease covid is characterized by pulmonary hyper inflammation and potentially life threatening cytokine storms controlling the local and systemic inflammatory response in covid may be as important as anti viral therapies endogenous lipid autacoid mediators referred to as eicosanoids play a critical role in the induction of inflammation and pro inflammatory cytokine production sars cov may trigger a cell death debris induced eicosanoid storm including prostaglandins and leukotrienes which in turn initiates a robust inflammatory response a paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro resolving lipid autacoid mediators spms such as resolvins resolvins and other spms stimulate macrophage mediated clearance of debris and counter pro inflammatory cytokine production a process called inflammation resolution spms and their lipid precursors exhibit anti viral activity at nanogram doses in the setting of influenza without being immunosuppressive spms also promote anti viral b cell antibodies and lymphocyte activity highlighting their potential use in the treatment of covid soluble epoxide hydrolase seh inhibitors stabilize arachidonic acid derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids eets which also stimulate inflammation resolution by promoting the production of pro resolution mediators activating anti inflammatory processes and preventing the cytokine storm both resolvins and eets also attenuate pathological thrombosis and promote clot removal which is emerging as a key pathology of covid infection thus both spms and seh inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in covid thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and other life threatening complications associated with robust viral induced inflammation while most covid clinical trials focus on anti viral and anti inflammatory strategies stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host centric therapeutic avenue importantly spms and seh inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of covid via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression here we discuss using pro resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti viral strategies for covid

Text: impaired type i interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe covid patients coronavirus disease covid is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression suggesting diverse host immune responses we performed an integrated immune analysis on a cohort of covid patients with various disease severity a unique phenotype was observed in severe and critical patients consisting of a highly impaired interferon ifn type i response characterized by no ifn β and low ifn α production and activity associated with a persistent blood viral load and an exacerbated inflammatory response inflammation was partially driven by the transcriptional factor nf κb and characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor tnf α and interleukin il production and signaling these data suggest that type i ifn deficiency in the blood could be a hallmark of severe covid and provide a rationale for combined therapeutic approaches

Text: re analysis of sars cov infected host cell proteomics time course data by impact pathway analysis and network analysis a potential link with inflammatory response the disease known as coronavirus disease covid potentially caused by an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in wuhan china has hit the world hard and has led to an unprecedent health and economic crisis in order to develop treatment options able to stop or ameliorate sars cov effects we need to understand the biology of the virus inside cells but this kind of studies are still scarce a recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by sars cov in the present study we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis proteins linked to inflammatory response but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis were found to be regulated the up regulation of the inflammatory related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of covid patients

Text: transcription factor nrf as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of cytokine storm in covid patients nrf is a key transcription factor responsible for antioxidant defense in many tissues and cells including alveolar epithelium endothelium and macrophages furthermore nrf functions as a transcriptional repressor that inhibits expression of the inflammatory cytokines in macrophages critically ill patients with covid infection often present signs of high oxidative stress and systemic inflammation the leading causes of mortality this article suggests rationale for the use of nrf inducers to prevent development of an excessive inflammatory response in covid patients

Text: lungs as target of covid infection protective common molecular mechanisms of vitamin d and melatonin as a new potential synergistic treatment covid pandemic has a high mortality rate and is affecting practically the entire world population the leading cause of death is severe acute respiratory syndrome as a consequence of exacerbated inflammatory response accompanied by uncontrolled oxidative stress as well as the inflammatory reaction at the lung level until now there is not a specific and definitive treatment for this pathology that worries the world population especially the older adults who constitute the main risk group in this context it results in a particular interest in the evaluation of the efficacy of existing pharmacological agents that may be used for overcoming or attenuating the severity of this pulmonary complication that has ended the lives of many people worldwide vitamin d and melatonin could be good options for achieving this aim taking into account that they have many shared underlying mechanisms that are able to modulate and control the immune adequately and oxidative response against covid infection possibly even through a synergistic interaction the renin angiotensin system exaltation with consequent inflammatory response has a leading role in the physiopathology of covid infection and it may be down regulated by vitamin d and melatonin in many organs therefore it is also essential to analyze this potential therapeutic association and their relation with ras as part of this new approach
