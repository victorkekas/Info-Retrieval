Text: shut and re open the role of schools in the spread of covid in europe we investigate the effect of school closure and subsequent reopening on the transmission of covid by considering denmark norway sweden and german states as case studies by comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalisations or confirmed cases under different interventions we provide evidence that the effect of school closure is visible as a reduction in the growth rate approximately days after implementation limited school attendance such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups does not appear to significantly affect community transmission a large scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible in countries such as denmark or norway where community transmission is generally low however school reopening can contribute to significant increases in the growth rate in countries like germany where community transmission is relatively high our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies that ensure low classroom occupancy and a solid infrastructure to quickly identify and isolate new infections

Text: expected impact of reopening schools after lockdown on covid epidemic in ile de france as several countries around the world are planning exit strategies to progressively lift the rigid social restrictions implemented with lockdown different options are being chosen regarding the closure or reopening of schools we evaluate the expected impact of reopening schools in lie de france region after the withdrawal of lockdown currently scheduled for may we explore several scenarios of partial progressive or full school reopening coupled with moderate social distancing interventions and large scale tracing testing and isolation accounting for current uncertainty on the role of children in covid epidemic we test different hypotheses on children s transmissibility distinguishing between younger children pre school and primary school age and adolescents middle and high school age reopening schools after lifting lockdown will likely lead to an increase in the number of covid cases in the following months even with lower transmissibility of children yet protocols exist that would allow maintaining the epidemic under control without saturating the healthcare system with pre schools and primary schools in session starting may icu occupation would reach at most probability ranges of a bed capacity here foreseen as the routine capacity restored in the region post first wave if no other school level reopens before summer or if middle and high schools reopen one month later through a progressive protocol increasing attendance week by week full attendance of adolescents at school starting in june would overwhelm the icu system occupation reopening all schools on may would likely lead to a second wave similar to the one recently experienced except if maximum attendance is limited to for both younger children and adolescents based on the estimated situation on may no substantial difference in the epidemic risk is predicted between progressive and prompt reopening of pre schools and primary schools thus allowing full attendance of younger children mostly in need of resuming learning and development reopening would require however large scale trace and testing to promptly isolate cases in addition to moderate social distancing interventions full attendance in middle and high schools is instead not recommended findings are consistent across different assumptions on the relative transmissibility of younger children and for small increase of the reproductive number possibly due to decreasing compliance to lockdown

Text: the impact of school reopening on the spread of covid in england background in the uk cases of covid have been declining since mid april and there is good evidence to suggest that the effective reproduction number has dropped below leading to a multi phase relaxation plan for the country to emerge from lockdown as part of this staggered process primary schools are scheduled to partially reopen on st june evidence from a range of sources suggests that children are in general only mildly affected by the disease and have low mortality rates though there is less certainty regarding children s role in transmission therefore there is wide discussion on the impact of reopening schools methods we compare eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in england from st june focusing on the return of particular year groups and the associated epidemic consequences this is assessed through model simulation modifying a previously developed dynamic transmission model for sars cov we quantify how the process of reopening schools affected contact patterns and anticipated secondary infections the relative change in r according to the extent of school reopening and determine the public health impact via estimated change in clinical cases and its sensitivity to decreases in adherence post strict lockdown findings whilst reopening schools in any form results in more mixing between children an increase in r and hence transmission of the disease the magnitude of that increase can be low dependent upon the age groups that return to school and the behaviour of the remaining population we predict that reopening schools in a way that allows half class sizes or that is focused on younger children is unlikely to push r above one although there is noticeable variation between the regions of the country given that older children have a greater number of social contacts and hence a greater potential for transmission our findings suggest reopening secondary schools results in larger increases in case burden than only reopening primary schools reopening both generates the largest increase and could push r above one in some regions the impact of less social distancing in the rest of the population generally has far larger effects than reopening schools and exacerbates the impacts of reopening discussion our work indicates that any reopening of schools will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population although the opening of schools alone is unlikely to push the value of r above one however impacts of other recent relaxations of lockdown measures are yet to be quantified suggesting some regions may be closer to the critical threshold that would lead to a growth in cases given the uncertainties in part due to limited data on covid in children school reopening should be carefully monitored ultimately the decision about reopening classrooms is a difficult trade off between increased epidemiological consequences and the emotional educational and developmental needs of children
