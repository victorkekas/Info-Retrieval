Text: modelling the potential impact of social distancing on the covid epidemic in south africa the novel coronavirus covid pandemic continues to be a global health problem whose impact has been significantly felt in south africa social distancing has been touted as the best form of response in managing a rapid increase in the number of infected cases in this paper we present a deterministic model to model the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of covid in south africa the model is fitted to the currently available data on the cumulative number of infected cases and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing are presented the results show a continued rise in the number of cases in the lock down period with the current levels of social distancing albeit at a lower rate the model shows that the number of cases will rise to above cases by the end of the lockdown the model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lock down measures a relaxation of the social distancing by can result in a rise in the number of cumulative cases while on the other hand increasing the levels of social distancing by would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about these results have implications on the management and policy direction in the early phases of the epidemic

Text: age structured impact of social distancing on the covid epidemic in india the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid has been declared a pandemic by the who the structures of social contact critically determine the spread of the infection and in the absence of vaccines the control of these structures through large scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective means of mitigation here we use an age structured sir model with social contact matrices obtained from surveys and bayesian imputation to study the progress of the covid epidemic in india the basic reproductive ratio r and its time dependent generalization are computed based on case data age distribution and social contact structure the impact of social distancing measures workplace non attendance school closure lockdown and their efficacy with durations are then investigated a three week lockdown is found insufficient to prevent a resurgence and instead protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested forecasts are provided for the reduction in age structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these measures our study underlines the importance of age and social contact structures in assessing the country specific impact of mitigatory social distancing

Text: impact of social distancing during covid pandemic on crime in los angeles and indianapolis governments have implemented social distancing measures to address the ongoing covid pandemic the measures include instructions that individuals maintain social distance when in public school closures limitations on gatherings and business operations and instructions to remain at home social distancing may have an impact on the volume and distribution of crime crimes such as residential burglary may decrease as a byproduct of increased guardianship over personal space and property crimes such as domestic violence may increase because of extended periods of contact between potential offenders and victims understanding the impact of social distancing on crime is critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to deal with the evolving crisis understanding how social distancing policies impact crime may also provide insights into whether people are complying with public health measures examination of the most recently available data from both los angeles ca and indianapolis in shows that social distancing has had a statistically significant impact on a few specific crime types however the overall effect is notably less than might be expected given the scale of the disruption to social and economic life

Text: impact of timing of and adherence to social distancing measures on covid burden in the us a simulation modeling approach background across the u s various social distancing measures were implemented to control covid pandemic however there is uncertainty in the effectiveness of such measures for specific regions with varying population demographics and different levels of adherence to social distancing the objective of this paper is to determine the impact of social distancing measures in unique regions methods we developed covid agent based simulation model covam an agent based simulation model abm that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering population demographics limited testing availability imported infections from outside of the region asymptomatic disease transmission and adherence to social distancing measures we adopted covam to represent covid associated events in dane county wisconsin milwaukee metropolitan area and new york city nyc we used covam to evaluate the impact of three different aspects of social distancing adherence to social distancing measures timing of implementing social distancing and timing of easing social distancing results we found that the timing of social distancing and adherence level had a major effect on covid occurrence for example in nyc implementing social distancing measures on march instead of march would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from to as of may whereas a week delay in implementing such measures could have increased the number of confirmed cases to easing social distancing measures on june instead of june in nyc would increase the total number of confirmed cases from to as of july conclusion the timing of implementing social distancing measures adherence to the measures and timing of their easing have major effects on the number of covid cases primary funding source national institute of allergy and infectious diseases institute

Text: modeling covid mortality in the us community context and mobility matter the united states has become an epicenter for the coronavirus disease covid pandemic however communities have been unequally affected and evidence is growing that social determinants of health may be exacerbating the pandemic furthermore the impact and timing of social distancing at the community level have yet to be fully explored we investigated the relative associations between covid mortality and social distancing sociodemographic makeup economic vulnerabilities and comorbidities in counties surrounding major metropolitan areas in the us using a flexible and robust time series modeling approach we found that counties with poorer health and less wealth were associated with higher daily mortality rates compared to counties with fewer economic vulnerabilities and fewer pre existing health conditions declines in mobility were associated with up to lower mortality rates relative to pre social distancing levels of mobility but effects were lagged between days while we cannot estimate causal impact this study provides insight into the association of social distancing on community mortality while accounting for key community factors for full transparency and reproducibility we provide all data and code used in this study

Text: estimating the impact of covid control measures using a bayesian model of physical distancing extensive physical distancing measures are currently the primary intervention against coronavirus disease covid worldwide it is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having we introduce a bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing measures with the timing of these measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and covid we fit our model to reported covid cases in british columbia canada using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting we estimate the impact that physical distancing also known as social distancing has had on the contact rate and examine the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures we find that distancing has had a strong impact consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers we estimate that approximately ci of contacts have been removed for individuals in british columbia practising physical distancing and that this fraction is above the threshold of at which prevalence is expected to grow however relaxing distancing measures beyond this threshold re starts rapid exponential growth because the extent of underestimation is unknown the data are consistent with a wide range in the prevalence of covid in the population changes to testing criteria over time introduce additional uncertainty our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures if sufficiently strong and robustly followed could control covid transmission but that if distancing measures are relaxed too much the epidemic curve would grow to high prevalence

Text: local decision making for implementing social distancing in response to outbreaks objectives social distancing is the practice of restricting contact among persons to prevent the spread of infection this study sought to identify key features of preparedness and the primary concerns of local public health officials in deciding to implement social distancing measures and determine whether any particular factor could explain the widespread variation among health departments in responses to past outbreaks methods we conducted an online survey of health departments in the united states in to understand factors influencing health departments decision making when choosing whether to implement social distancing measures we paired survey results with data on area population demographic characteristics and analyzed them with a focus on broad trends results of health departments contacted responded of these health departments indicated that they had implemented social distancing in the past years only health departments had a line item budget for isolation or quarantine the most common concern about social distancing was public health impact n concerns about law politics finances vulnerable populations and sociocultural issues were each identified by to of health departments we were unable to clearly predict which factors would influence these decisions conclusions variations in the decision to implement social distancing are likely the result of differences in organizational authority and resources and in the primary concerns about implementing social distancing research and current social distancing guidelines for health departments should address these factors

Text: augmenting contact matrices with time use data for fine grained intervention modelling of disease dynamics a modelling analysis background social distancing is an important public health intervention to reduce or interrupt the sustained community transmission of emerging infectious pathogens such as sars cov during the coronavirus disease covid pandemic we aimed to explore the impact on the epidemic curve of fewer contacts when individuals reduce the time they spend on selected daily activities methods we combined the large scale empirical data of a social contact survey and a time use survey to estimate contact matrices by age group and daily activity work schooling transportation and four leisure activities social visits bar cafe restaurant visits park visits and non essential shopping we assumed that reductions in time are proportional to reductions in contacts the derived matrices were then applied in an age structured dynamic transmission model of covid to explore the effects findings the relative reductions in the derived contact matrices were highest when closing schools in ages years workplaces years and stopping social visits years for covid the closure of workplaces schools and stopping social visits had the largest impact on reducing the epidemic curve and delaying its peak while the predicted impact of fewer contacts in parks bars cafes restaurants and non essential shopping were minimal interpretation we successfully augmented contact matrices with time use data to predict the highest impact of social distancing measures from reduced contacts when spending less time at work school and on social visits although the predicted impact from other leisure activities with potential for close physical contact were minimal changes in mixing patterns and time use immediately after re allowing social activities may pose increased short term transmission risks especially in potentially crowded environments indoors

Text: defining facets of social distancing during the covid pandemic twitter analysis social distancing has been one of the primary mitigation strategies in the united states to control the spread of novel coronavirus disease covid and can be viewed as a multi faceted public health measure using twitter data we aim to define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the covid pandemic in the us in a spatiotemporal context and examine the most amplified tweets among social distancing facets we analyzed a total of unique tweets containing coronavirus from unique users between january and march that were identified by the twitter api as english and u s based tweets containing specified keywords determined a priori were grouped into six social distancing facets implementation purpose social disruption adaptation positive emotions and negative emotions tweets about social disruptiveness were most retweeted and implementation tweets were most favorited social distancing tweets became overall more prevalent in the u s from late january to march but were not geographically uniform in january and february facets of social distancing appeared in los angeles san francisco and seattle which were among the first cities impacted by the covid outbreak tweets related to the implementation and negative emotions facets of social distancing largely dominated in combination with topics of social disruption and adaptation albeit to a lesser degree social distancing can be defined in terms of facets that respond and represent certain moments and events in a pandemic including travel restrictions and rising covid case counts for example in february miami fl had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in march which corresponded with the rise of covid cases in the city this suggests that overall volume of social distancing tweets can reflect the relative case count in respective locations

Text: economic impact of government interventions during the covid pandemic international evidence from financial markets the outbreak of covid pandemic came as a rare unprecedented event and governments around the globe scrambled with emergency actions including social distancing measures public awareness programs testing and quarantining policies and income support packages in this paper we examine the expected economic impact of government actions by analyzing the effect of such actions on stock market returns using daily data from january to april from countries we find announcements of government social distancing measures have a direct negative effect on stock market returns due to their adverse effect on economic activity while an indirect positive effect through the reduction in covid confirmed cases government announcements regarding public awareness programs testing and quarantining policies and income support packages largely result in positive market returns our findings have important policy implications primarily by showing that government social distancing measures have both positive and negative economic impact

Text: mathematical assessment of the impact of non pharmaceutical interventions on curtailing the novel coronavirus a pandemic of a novel coronavirus emerged in december of covid causing devastating public health impact across the world in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals strategies for con trolling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing contact tracing quarantine isolation and the use of face masks in public we develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold known as the reproduction number denoted by rc is less than unity this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for a special case of the model where quarantined susceptible individuals do not acquire covid infection during quarantine when rc is less than unity the epidemiological consequence of this theoretical result is that the community wide implementation of control interventions that can bring and maintain rc to a value less than unity will lead to the effective control or elimination of covid in the community simulations of the model using data relevant to covid transmission dynamics in the us state of new york and the entire us show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late april respectively the worst case scenario projections for cumulative mortality based on baseline levels of interventions are for new york state and for the entire us by the end of the pandemic these numbers dramatically decreased by and respectively if adherence to strict social distancing measures is improved and maintained until the end of may or june the duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social distancing measures are crucially important in determining the future trajectory of the covid pandemic this study shows that early termination of the strict social distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social distance measures were implemented the use of efficacious face masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least of the residents of new york state use such masks in public consistently nationwide a compliance of at least will be required using such masks the use of low efficacy masks such as cloth masks of estimated efficacy less than could also lead to significant reduction of covid burden albeit they are not able to lead to elimination combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti covid intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic this study emphasizes the important role social distancing plays in curtailing the burden of covid increases in the adherence level of social distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic and the timely implementation of social distancing measures in numerous states of the us may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of covid using face masks in public including the low efficacy cloth masks is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of covid provided their coverage level is high the masks coverage needed to eliminate covid decreases if the masks based intervention is combined with the strict social distancing strategy
