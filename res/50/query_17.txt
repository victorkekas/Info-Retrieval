Text: a large number of covid interventional clinical trials were registered soon after the pandemic onset a descriptive analysis background and objective there is a pressing need for evidence based interventions to address the devastating clinical and public health effects of the coronavirus disease covid pandemic the number of registered trials related to covid is increasing by the day the objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of the currently registered interventional clinical trials related to covid methods we searched the world health organization s international clinical trials registry platform on may th we included any entry that is related to covid we abstracted and then descriptively analyzed the following characteristics of the registered trials study design status phase primary endpoints experimental interventions and geographic location among other qualifiers results we identified eligible registered trials most trials were registered with clinicaltrials gov n and the chinese clinical trial registry n the number of participants to be enrolled across these trials was with a median of participants per trial the most commonly studied intervention category was pharmacologic n with antiparasitic medications being the most common subcategory although over half of the trials were already recruiting we identified published peer reviewed results for only of those trials conclusion there is a relatively large number of registered trials but with very few results published so far although our findings suggest an appropriate initial response by the research community the real challenge will be to get these trials completed published and translated into practice and policy

Text: remote methods for conducting tobacco focused clinical trials most tobacco focused clinical trials are based on locally conducted studies that face significant challenges to implementation and successful execution these challenges include the need for large diverse yet still representative study samples this often means a protracted costly and inefficient recruitment process multi site clinical trials can overcome some of these hurdles but incur their own unique challenges with recent advances in mobile health mhealth and digital technologies there is now a promising alternative remote trials these trials are led and coordinated by a local investigative team but are based remotely within a given community state or even nation the remote approach affords many of the benefits of multi site trials more efficient recruitment of larger study samples without the same barriers cost multi site management regulatory hurdles the coronavirus disease covid global health pandemic has resulted in rapid requirements to shift ongoing clinical trials to remote delivery and assessment platforms making methods for the conduct of remote trials even more timely the purpose of the present manuscript it to provide an overview of available methods for the conduct of remote tobacco focused clinical trials as well as illustrative examples of how these methods have been implemented across recently completed and ongoing tobacco studies we focus on key aspects of the clinical trial pipeline including remote study recruitment and screening informed consent assessment biomarker collection and medication adherence monitoring
