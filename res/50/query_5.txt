Text: the importance of animal models in the development of vaccines efficient translation of basic vaccine research into clinical therapies greatly depends upon the availability of appropriate animal models testing novel vaccine candidates in animal models is a critical step in the development of modern vaccines animal models are being used to assess the quality and quantity of the immune response to identify the optimal route of delivery and formulation to determine protection from infection and disease transmission and to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the vaccine formulation animal models help to make the translation from basic research to clinical application and they often allow prediction of the vaccine potential which helps in predicting the financial risks for vaccine manufacturers choosing an appropriate animal model has become increasingly important for the field as each model has its own advantages and disadvantages in this review the criteria for selecting the right animal model the advantages and disadvantages of various animal models as well as the future needs for animal models are being discussed

Text: covid organoids go viral the coronavirus disease covid pandemic underscores the threat posed by newly emerging viruses understanding the biology of novel viruses rests in large part on in vitro models that allow viral replication human and animal organoids are now proving their value as an experimental virology platform

Text: small animal models of filovirus disease recent advances and future directions introduction small animal models have played a critical role in understanding the pathogenesis and transmission of disease caused by filoviruses notably small animals have served to identify and validate many different approaches to countering infection with these highly pathogenic viruses nonetheless predictive efficacy between each model does not appear to be equivalent as higher order animals seem to be more prognostic and therefore successful in the evaluation of medical countermeasures mcm areas covered this review comprehensively details the available small animal models of filovirus infection and discusses the benefits and shortcomings of each model with respect to the development of mcm an up to date evaluation of mouse hamster guinea pig and ferret models is provided expert opinion the recent development of the domestic ferret model for ebolavirus offers a small animal model that faithfully reproduces most features of human disease without the need for viral adaptation or an immunocompromised host that being said choosing a small animal model to evaluate a particular mcm must consider potential confounders associated with each model these confounding issues include incomplete host immune systems or mutations in the challenge virus that enables the disease

Text: a comparative review of animal models of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov was initially isolated from a saudi arabian man with fatal pneumonia since the original case in mers cov infections have been reported in humans and the case fatality rate is currently this lineage c betacoronavirus has been reported to cause a wide range of disease severity in humans ranging from asymptomatic to progressive fatal pneumonia that may be accompanied by renal or multiorgan failure although the clinical presentation of human mers cov infection has been documented many facets of this emerging disease are still unknown and could be studied with animal models several animal models of mers cov have been developed including new zealand white rabbits transduced or transgenic mice that express human dipeptidyl peptidase rhesus macaques and common marmosets this review provides an overview of the current state of knowledge on human mers cov infections the probable origin of mers cov and the available animal models of mers cov infection evaluation of the benefits and limitations of these models will aid in appropriate model selection for studying viral pathogenesis and transmission as well as for testing vaccines and antivirals against mers cov

Text: animal models of acute lung injury acute lung injury in humans is characterized histopathologically by neutrophilic alveolitis injury of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium hyaline membrane formation and microvascular thrombi different animal models of experimental lung injury have been used to investigate mechanisms of lung injury most are based on reproducing in animals known risk factors for ards such as sepsis lipid embolism secondary to bone fracture acid aspiration ischemia reperfusion of pulmonary or distal vascular beds and other clinical risks however none of these models fully reproduces the features of human lung injury the goal of this review is to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of existing models of lung injury we review the specific features of human ards that should be modeled in experimental lung injury and then discuss specific characteristics of animal species that may affect the pulmonary host response to noxious stimuli we emphasize those models of lung injury that are based on reproducing risk factors for human ards in animals and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model and the extent to which each model reproduces human ards the present review will help guide investigators in the design and interpretation of animal studies of acute lung injury

Text: animal models for sars and mers coronaviruses the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov two strains of animal coronaviruses that crossed the species barrier to infect and cause severe respiratory infections in humans within the last years have taught us that coronaviruses represent a global threat that does not recognize international borders we can expect to see other novel coronaviruses emerge in the future an ideal animal model should reflect the clinical signs viral replication and pathology seen in humans in this review we present factors to consider in establishing an animal model for the study of novel coronaviruses and compare the different animal models that have been employed to study sars cov and mers cov
