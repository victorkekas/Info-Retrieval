Text: ultra sensitive nanozyme based chemiluminescence paper test for rapid diagnosis of sars cov infection the recently emerged coronavirus disease covid has now evolved into a global pandemic early detection is crucial for its effective control nucleic acid testing for viral pathogen and serological testing for host antibodies are playing important roles in current covid diagnosis however while nucleic acid testing is complicated facility restricted and time consuming antibody testing may result in high rates of false negative diagnoses especially during the early stages of viral infection thus a more rapid and reliable test for both early covid diagnosis and whole population screening is urgently needed here we developed a novel nanozyme based chemiluminescence paper assay for rapid and high sensitive testing of sars cov spike antigen our paper test uses a newly established peroxidase mimic co fe hemin nanozyme instead of natural hrp that catalytically amplifies the chemiluminescent signal allowing for target concentrations to be as low as ng ml furthermore our nanozyme based chemiluminescence test exhibits a linear range that is fold wider compared to elisa tests importantly testing is completed in less than min compared to h required for elisa or nucleic acid tests critically signal detection is feasible using a smartphone camera ingredients for our test are simple and readily available rendering overall cost considerably lower than those used in current diagnoses in conclusion our novel test provides a high sensitive point of care testing poct approach for sars cov antigen detection which should greatly increase current early screening capacities for suspected infections and considerably lower demand for national healthcare resources

Text: severe underestimation of covid case numbers effect of epidemic growth rate and test restrictions to understand the scope and development of the covid pandemic knowledge of the number of infected persons is essential often the number of confirmed cases which is based on positive rt pcr test results is regarded as a reasonable indicator however limited covid test capacities in many countries are restricting the amount of testing that can be done this can lead to the implementation of testing policies that restrict access to covid tests and to testing backlogs and delays as a result confirmed case numbers can be significantly lower than the actual number of infections especially during rapid growth phases of the epidemic this study examines the quantitative relation between infections and reported confirmed case numbers for two different testing strategies limited and inclusive testing in relation to the growth rate of the epidemic the results indicate that confirmed case numbers understate the actual number of infections substantially during rapid growth phases where the daily growth rate can reach or exceed as has been seen in many countries the confirmed case numbers under report actual infections by up to to fold

Text: cochrane review rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the emergency department background pediatric acute respiratory infections aris represent a significant burden on pediatric emergency departments ed and families most of these illnesses are due to viruses however investigations radiography blood and urine testing to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties this results in prolonged ed visits and unnecessary antibiotic use the risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection rapid viral testing in the ed may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use objectives to determine the effect of rapid viral testing in the ed on the rate of precautionary testing antibiotic use and ed length of visit search strategy we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials central the cochrane library issue which contains the ari group s specialized register medline to april week embase to week medline in process other non indexed citations april healthstar to biosis previews to cab abstracts to cbca reference to and proquest dissertations and theses to selection criteria randomized controlled trials rcts of rapid viral testing for children with aris in the ed data collection and analysis two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials evaluate their quality and extract data missing data were obtained from trial authors differences in rate of investigations and antibiotics use were expressed as risk ratios rr and difference in ed length of visits was expressed as mean difference with confidence interval ci main results four trials were included three rcts and one quazi rct with children in the rapid viral testing and in the control group rapid viral testing did not reduce antibiotic use in the ed significantly neither clinically nor statistically we found lower rates of chest radiography rr ci to in the rapid viral testing group but no effect on length of ed visits blood or urine testing in the ed authors conclusions current evidence is insufficient although promising to support routine rapid viral testing as a means to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric eds results suggest that rapid viral testing may be beneficial but are not statistically significant due to lack of power a large trial addressing these outcome measures is needed plain language summary does rapid viral testing in the emergency department affect the treatment of children with fever and respiratory problems children admitted to emergency departments ed with fever and respiratory symptoms represent a major burden to the health care system as well as significant anxiety and expense to parents and caregivers physicians often order diagnostic tests and may prescribe antibiotics when they are unsure of the cause of the illness and are concerned about the possibility of serious bacterial infection however in most cases fever and respiratory symptoms are caused by viruses in addition in children in whom a virus is found to be the cause of their illness the risk of serious bacterial infection is very low this review was conducted to assess whether a rapid viral test done in the ed changes what physicians do when treating these children we found that in previously healthy children coming to the ed with fever and respiratory symptoms a rapid viral test reduces the use of chest x rays and that there is a trend toward less antibiotic usage and blood and urine investigations the true impact of this intervention on the latter three outcomes requires trials with larger enrollment numbers
