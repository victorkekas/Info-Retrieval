Text: understanding the current status of patients with pulmonary hypertension during covid outbreak a small scale national survey from china pulmonary hypertension is a chronic disease developing progressively with high mortality pulmonary hypertension patients need persistent medical care however limited reports focused on them when there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease in china this national survey was aimed to evaluate the overall condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during this period a questionnaire regarding the living condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during coronavirus disease was designed by pulmonary hypertension diagnostic experts in wuhan asia heart hospital pulmonary hypertension patients and their family members were invited to participate in this survey online one hundred twenty pulmonary hypertension patients and family members participated in the survey n participants came from hubei and others were from other provinces n participants were in home quarantine n were pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease and n patients proclaimed their heart function was well maintained at class i or ii one patient was confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection two patients were hospitalized due to heart function worsening nearly n participants implied shortage in medications during coronavirus disease outbreak a total of n patients indicated that medications were discontinued due to the insufficient supply most of the participants stayed optimistic on either coronavirus disease outbreak or their pulmonary hypertension disease and n patients would go to the hospital for follow up immediately after outbreak these preliminary data show pulmonary hypertension patients are able to avoid severe disease when they are in home quarantine medication supplement is important for pulmonary hypertension patients when their heart function is well maintained in addition there might be increasing requirements of medical care for pulmonary hypertension patients after the outbreak

Text: hypertension the renin angiotensin system and the risk of lower respiratory tract infections and lung injury implications for covid systemic arterial hypertension referred to as hypertension herein is a major risk factor of mortality worldwide and its importance is further emphasized in the context of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov infection referred to as covid patients with severe covid infections commonly are older and have a history of hypertension almost of patients who have died in the pandemic in italy had hypertension this raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of covid in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin angiotensin system ras blockers e g angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs we provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension ras and risk of lung injury we demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for covid interestingly aceis and arbs may be associated with lower incidence and or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections we also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the ras to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with ras blockers in patients with covid and a high cardiovascular and renal risk this is related to the role of angiotensin converting enzyme ace for sars cov entry into cells and expression of ace in the lung cardiovascular system kidney and other tissues in summary a critical review of available evidence does not support a deleterious effect of ras blockers in covid infections therefore there is currently no reason to discontinue ras blockers in stable patients facing the covid pandemic

Text: impact of chronic comorbidities on progression and prognosis in patients with covid a retrospective cohort study in hospitalized cases in wuhan china background the recent outbreak of covid has rapidly spread worldwide a large proportion of covid patients with chronic underlying complications have been reported to be in severe condition and show unpromising clinical outcomes but whether chronic comorbidities are risk factors affecting the severity of covid has not been well described methods we included covid patients who had been admitted to tongji hospital tongji medical college of hust wuhan china from january to march in this retrospective cohort study the final date of follow up was march all patients were diagnosed with covid according to prevention and control scheme for novel coronavirus pneumonia published by national health commission of the people s republic of china and who interim demographic data medical history clinical symptoms and signs laboratory findings chest computed tomography ct treatment and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records with standardized data collection forms and compared among different groups results covid inpatients were included in this study of whom were discharged and were dead in hospital of dead patients had complicated chronic comorbidities of the patients were combined with chronic comorbidities and showed cfr times as that of patients without any underlying disease the number of patients with hypertension accounted for three fourths of those with concomitant underlying diseases the univariable regression revealed that patients in the simple hypertension group showed overall risk higher than those in the simple diabetes mellitus group in the age grouped research patients in the hypertension senile group were proved to be at the highest risk which might be associated with the level of ldh and egfr in this retrospective cohort study patients with hypertension took ccb during the hospitalization the odds ratio of cfr in patients with hypertension taking ccb group was p compared to those not conclusion our data shows that the clinical manifestations of most hospitalized patients with covid are actually systemic syndromes although covid is defined as novel coronavirus pneumonia in china hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity but also a risk factor affecting the severity of covid and does play a critical role in improving patients clinical outcomes therefore hypertension management in patients with covid should be a major challenge in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies including optimal management of blood pressure and pathophysiological status

Text: roles of inflammation oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in hypertension hypertension is a complex condition and is the most common cardiovascular risk factor contributing to widespread morbidity and mortality approximately of hypertension cases are classified as essential hypertension where the precise cause is unknown hypertension is associated with inflammation however whether inflammation is a cause or effect of hypertension is not well understood the purpose of this review is to describe evidence from human and animal studies that inflammation leads to the development of hypertension as well as the evidence for involvement of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction both thought to be key steps in the development of hypertension other potential proinflammatory conditions that contribute to hypertension such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system aging and elevated aldosterone are also discussed finally we consider the potential benefit of anti inflammatory drugs and statins for antihypertensive therapy the evidence reviewed suggests that inflammation can lead to the development of hypertension and that oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are involved in the inflammatory cascade aging and aldosterone may also both be involved in inflammation and hypertension hence in the absence of serious side effects anti inflammatory drugs could potentially be used to treat hypertension in the future
