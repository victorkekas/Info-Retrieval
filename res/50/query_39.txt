Text: lung under attack by covid induced cytokine storm pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic implications the lung is a key target of the cytokine storm that can be triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov responsible for the widespread clinical syndrome known as coronavirus disease covid indeed in some patients sars cov promotes a dysfunctional immune response that dysregulates the cytokine secretory pattern hypercytokinemia underlies the hyperinflammatory state leading to injury of alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells as well as to lung infiltration sustained by neutrophils and macrophages within such a pathogenic context interleukin il and other cytokines chemokines play a pivotal pro inflammatory role therefore cytokines and their receptors as well as cytokine dependent intracellular signalling pathways can be targeted by potential therapies aimed to relieve the heavy burden of cytokine storm in particular the anti il receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab is emerging as one of the most promising pharmacologic treatments the reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section
