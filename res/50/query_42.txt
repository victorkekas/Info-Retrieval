Text: spurious correlation a review of the relationship between vitamin d and covid infection and mortality the study reviews the evidence presented in a recent study linking vitamin d levels and covid infection and mortality it was argued that correlation alone may not be useful in establishing a relationship between vitamin d levels and covid infections and mortality appropriate controls need to be included for improved understanding of the relationship we proposed life expectancy as a potential control including this control in a regression model we find that vitamin d levels are not a statistically significant predictor of covid infections or mortality life expectancy on the other hand was found to be statistically significant predictor of infections and mortality at country level

Text: beneficial role of vitamin d in the prevention of certain respiratory diseases there is evidence of aberrations in the vitamin d endocrine system in subjects with respiratory diseases vitamin d deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with respiratory diseases and patients who receive vitamin d have significantly larger improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake studies have provided an opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin d to respiratory pathology including the major histocompatibility complex class ii molecules vitamin d receptor vitamin d binding protein chromosome p toll like receptors poly adp ribose polymerase and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate vitamin d also exerts its effect on respiratory diseases through cell signaling mechanisms including matrix metalloproteinases mitogen activated protein kinase pathways the wnt β catenin signaling pathway prostaglandins reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide synthase in conclusion vitamin d plays a significant role in respiratory diseases the best form of vitamin d for use in the treatment of respiratory diseases is calcitriol because it is the active metabolite of vitamin d and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression further investigation of calcitriol in respiratory diseases is needed

Text: double covid confirmed case fatality rate in countries with high elderly female vitamin d deficiency prevalence a number of clues point to a possible role of vitamin d in fighting covid a reduction in case growth speed with solar zenith angle higher fatality rate in black people lower fatality rate in populations that spend more time outdoors yet a direct demonstration that vitamin d deficiency is associated with covid fatalities has remained elusive we show here in a comparison of countries that countries with high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency among elderly females show a confirmed case fatality rate twice as high as those with low prevalence we then show that this effect cannot be explained by differences in life expectancy between countries a mechanistic role for vitamin d in the severity of covid is proposed

Text: vitamin d deficiency an update on the current status worldwide vitamin d testing and the use of vitamin d supplements have increased substantially in recent years currently the role of vitamin d supplementation and the optimal vitamin d dose and status is a subject of debate because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit in mostly vitamin d replete populations this may be attributed to limitations in trial design as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study including vitamin d replete populations too small sample sizes and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites vitamin d deficiency serum hydroxyvitamin d oh d nmol l or ng ml is therefore the primary treatment goal although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold severe vitamin d deficiency with a oh d concentration below nmol l or ng ml dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality infections and many other diseases and should be avoided whenever possible the data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections at least in severely deficient individuals appear convincing vitamin d is clearly not a panacea and is most likely efficient only in deficiency given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin it may be an important inexpensive and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases but future large and well designed studies should evaluate this further a worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin d supplementation in certain risk groups and systematic vitamin d food fortification to avoid severe vitamin d deficiency would appear to be important in this narrative review the current international literature on vitamin d deficiency its relevance and therapeutic options is discussed
