Text: an econometric analysis of sars and avian flu on international tourist arrivals to asia abstract this paper compares the impacts of sars and human deaths arising from avian flu on international tourist arrivals to asia the effects of sars and human deaths from avian flu are compared directly according to the number of human deaths the nature of the short run and long run relationship is examined empirically by estimating a static line fixed effect model and a difference transformation dynamic model respectively empirical results from the static fixed effect and difference transformation dynamic models are consistent and indicate that both the short run and long run sars effect have a more significant impact on international tourist arrivals than does avian flu in addition the effects of deaths arising from both sars and avian flu suggest that sars is more important to international tourist arrivals than is avian flu thus while avian flu is here to stay its effect is currently not as significant as that of sars

Text: pollen explains flu like and covid seasonality current models for flu like epidemics insufficiently explain multi cycle seasonality meteorological factors alone do not predict seasonality given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu like epidemics or covid pollen is documented to be antiviral and allergenic play a role in immuno activation and seems to create a bio aerosol lowering the reproduction number of flu like viruses therefore we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu like epidemics including covid we tested the pollen flu seasonality theory for flu like seasons including covid in the netherlands with its million inhabitants we combined changes in flu like incidence per k dutch citizens code ili with weekly pollen counts and meteorological data for the same period finally a discrete predictive model is tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values displaying inhibitory effects on flu like incidence we found a highly significant inverse association of r between pollen and changes in flu like incidence corrected for incubation period confirming our expectations for the covid season we found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu like incidence of r p when pollen thresholds of total pollen grains m per week allergenic pollen grains m per week and a solar radiation threshold of j cm are passed the passing of at least the pollen thresholds preludes the beginning and end of flu like seasons solar radiation is a supportive factor temperature makes no difference and relative humidity associates even with flu like incidence increases we conclude that pollen is a predictor for the inverse seasonality of flu like epidemics including covid and solar radiation is a co inhibitor the observed seasonality of covid during spring suggests that covid may revive in the netherlands after week the start being preceded by the relative absence of pollen and follows standard pollen flu seasonality patterns

Text: patterns of mortality during pandemic an example of spanish flu pandemic of now the attention of the whole world is focused on the developing pandemic of the coronavirus infection covid this article discusses mortality patterns of the deadliest epidemic in the last years the spanish flu pandemic of statistical sources from italy and the usa published shortly after the pandemic were analyzed the analysis was carried out for mortality from all causes since in this case inaccuracies associated with establishing the causes of death are minimized despite the fact that the first cases of the spanish flu appeared in the united states as early as march this first wave of epidemic practically did not affect the total mortality rate the main peak of mortality in occurred in october both in the usa and italy with a gradual decrease in mortality over several months analysis of age specific mortality demonstrates a significant increase in mortality at middle ages years in compared with analysis of mortality trends using the method of latent variables shows a significant increase in the background mortality factor in which turned out to be higher for italy than the mortality losses during the second world war the spanish flu pandemic differs from the current coronavirus pandemic because of significant increase in mortality of middle aged people while the covid pandemic causes a more marked increase in mortality among the elderly with this the covid pandemic is more like the recent flu epidemics than the earlier spanish flu pandemic

Text: the matrix segment of the spanish flu virus originated from intragenic recombination between avian and human influenza a viruses the spanish flu virus has claimed more than million lives however the mechanism of its high pathogenicity remains elusive and the origin of the virus is controversial the matrix m segment regulates the replication of influenza a virus thereby affecting its virulence and pathogenicity this study found that the m segment of the spanish flu virus is a recombinant chimera originating from avian influenza virus and human influenza virus the unique mosaic m segment might confer the virus high replication capacity showing that the recombination might play an important role in inducing high pathogenicity of the virus in addition this study also suggested that the na and ns segments of the virus were generated by reassortment between mammalian and avian viruses direct phylogenetic evidence was also provided for its avian origin

Text: relationship between average daily temperature and average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases of covid the rapid outbreak of the new coronavirus covid pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide especially in the northern hemisphere have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus and in particular the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized the main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions the main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature to test this research hypothesis we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through f test and independent samples t test in all five selected countries we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases conversely if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions
