Text: super spreader businesses and risk of covid transmission purpose the united states has the highest number of confirmed covid cases in the world to date with over covid related deaths the true risk of a covid resurgence as states prepare to reopen businesses is unknown this paper aims to classify businesses by their risk of transmission and quantify the relationship between the density of super spreader businesses and covid cases methods we constructed a covid business transmission risk index based upon the frequency and duration of visits and square footage of businesses pre pandemic in in states massachusetts rhode island connecticut new hampshire vermont maine new york and california we used this index to classify businesses as super spreaders then we analyzed the association between the density of super spreader businesses in a county and the rate of covid cases we performed significance testing using a negative binomial regression the main outcome of interest is the cumulative number of covid cases each week results we found a positive association between the density of super spreader businesses and covid cases a percentage point increase in the density of super spreader businesses is associated with higher covid cases all else equal conclusion higher densities of super spreader businesses are associated with higher rates of covid cases this may have important implications for how states reopen super spreader businesses

Text: spatial super spreaders and super susceptibles in human movement networks as lockdowns and stay at home orders start to be lifted across the globe governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies in dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging if not practically impossible governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading indeed certain places like some people can be super spreaders is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs here we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super spreaders and the novel concept of super susceptibles i e respectively places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it our proposed data analytic framework is based on the daily aggregated ridership data of public transport in singapore by constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics we are able to pinpoint super spreader and super susceptible locations our results reveal that most super spreaders are also super susceptibles and that counterintuitively busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations our analysis is based on data from singapore but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center it therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness

Text: super spreaders in infectious diseases summary early studies that explored host pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others subsequently in what became known as the rule a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events this empirical rule was shown to govern inter individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts as compared to most others became known as super spreaders studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pandemic revealed that in the absence of super spreading events most individuals infect few if any secondary contacts the analysis of sars transmission and reports from other outbreaks unveil a complex scenario in which super spreading events are shaped by multiple factors including co infection with another pathogen immune suppression changes in airflow dynamics delayed hospital admission misdiagnosis and inter hospital transfers predicting and identifying super spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans

Text: unlinking super linkers the topology of epidemic response covid a key characteristic of the spread of infectious diseases is their ability to use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs this enables the pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population in this work we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within human contact networks proximity graphs experimental results of disease spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease spreading however to stop disease spreading contact tracing requires both significant visibility at least into the proximity graph and the ability to place half of the population under isolation we find that pro actively isolating super links key proximity encounters has significant benefits targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on visibility into the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak it turns out that isolating super spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less effective than targeting super links we highlight the important role of topology in epidemic outbreaks we argue that proactive innoculation of a population by disabling super links and super spreaders may have an important complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a sophisticated public health response to epidemic outbreaks

Text: super spreaders and the rate of transmission of the sars virus abstract we describe a stochastic small world network model of transmission of the sars virus unlike the standard susceptible infected removed models of disease transmission our model exhibits both geographically localised outbreaks and super spreaders moreover the combination of localised and long range links allows for more accurate modelling of partial isolation and various public health policies from this model we derive an expression for the probability of a widespread outbreak and a condition to ensure that the epidemic is controlled moreover multiple simulations are used to make predictions of the likelihood of various eventual scenarios for fixed initial conditions the main conclusions of this study are i super spreaders may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant ii consistent with previous reports extended exposure time beyond days i e significant nosocomial transmission was the key factor in the severity of the sars outbreak in hong kong and iii the spread of sars can be effectively controlled by either limiting long range links imposing a partial quarantine or enforcing rapid hospitalisation and isolation of symptomatic individuals

Text: clustering model for transmission of the sars virus application to epidemic control and risk assessment abstract we propose a new four state model for disease transmission and illustrate the model with data from the sars epidemic in hong kong the critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small world network of interconnected nodes each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes transmission can only propagate between linked nodes this model exhibits two features typical of sars transmission geographically localized outbreaks and super spreaders neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible infected removed models of disease transmission our analysis indicates that super spreaders may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant moreover we find that nosocomial transmission in hong kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to days the extent of the sars epidemic would have been minimal
