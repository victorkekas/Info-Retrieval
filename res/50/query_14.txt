Text: spatial super spreaders and super susceptibles in human movement networks as lockdowns and stay at home orders start to be lifted across the globe governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies in dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging if not practically impossible governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading indeed certain places like some people can be super spreaders is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs here we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super spreaders and the novel concept of super susceptibles i e respectively places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it our proposed data analytic framework is based on the daily aggregated ridership data of public transport in singapore by constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics we are able to pinpoint super spreader and super susceptible locations our results reveal that most super spreaders are also super susceptibles and that counterintuitively busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations our analysis is based on data from singapore but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center it therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness

Text: super spreaders and the rate of transmission of the sars virus abstract we describe a stochastic small world network model of transmission of the sars virus unlike the standard susceptible infected removed models of disease transmission our model exhibits both geographically localised outbreaks and super spreaders moreover the combination of localised and long range links allows for more accurate modelling of partial isolation and various public health policies from this model we derive an expression for the probability of a widespread outbreak and a condition to ensure that the epidemic is controlled moreover multiple simulations are used to make predictions of the likelihood of various eventual scenarios for fixed initial conditions the main conclusions of this study are i super spreaders may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant ii consistent with previous reports extended exposure time beyond days i e significant nosocomial transmission was the key factor in the severity of the sars outbreak in hong kong and iii the spread of sars can be effectively controlled by either limiting long range links imposing a partial quarantine or enforcing rapid hospitalisation and isolation of symptomatic individuals

Text: unlinking super linkers the topology of epidemic response covid a key characteristic of the spread of infectious diseases is their ability to use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs this enables the pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population in this work we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within human contact networks proximity graphs experimental results of disease spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease spreading however to stop disease spreading contact tracing requires both significant visibility at least into the proximity graph and the ability to place half of the population under isolation we find that pro actively isolating super links key proximity encounters has significant benefits targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on visibility into the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak it turns out that isolating super spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less effective than targeting super links we highlight the important role of topology in epidemic outbreaks we argue that proactive innoculation of a population by disabling super links and super spreaders may have an important complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a sophisticated public health response to epidemic outbreaks

Text: clustering model for transmission of the sars virus application to epidemic control and risk assessment abstract we propose a new four state model for disease transmission and illustrate the model with data from the sars epidemic in hong kong the critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small world network of interconnected nodes each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes transmission can only propagate between linked nodes this model exhibits two features typical of sars transmission geographically localized outbreaks and super spreaders neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible infected removed models of disease transmission our analysis indicates that super spreaders may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant moreover we find that nosocomial transmission in hong kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to days the extent of the sars epidemic would have been minimal

Text: importance of interaction structure and stochasticity for epidemic spreading a covid case study in the recent covid pandemic computer simulations are used to predict the evolution of the virus propagation and to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non pharmaceutical interventions as such the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision making typically ode based models are considered in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time in this work we translate an ode based covid spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures we observe a large dependency of the epidemic s dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph which is not adequately captured by existing ode models for instance existence of super spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super spreaders overall we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number r we conclude that deterministic models fitted to covid outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights

Text: contact tracing and disease control contact tracing followed by treatment or isolation is a key control measure in the battle against infectious diseases it is an extreme form of locally targeted control and as such has the potential to be highly efficient when dealing with low numbers of cases for this reason it is frequently used to combat sexually transmitted diseases and new invading pathogens accurate modelling of contact tracing requires explicit information about the disease transmission pathways from each individual and hence the network of contacts here pairwise approximation methods and full stochastic simulations are used to investigate the utility of contact tracing a simple relationship is found between the efficiency of contact tracing necessary for eradication and the basic reproductive ratio of the disease this holds for a wide variety of realistic situations including heterogeneous networks containing core groups or super spreaders and asymptomatic individuals clustering transitivity within the transmission network is found to destroy the relationship requiring lower efficiency than predicted

Text: minimising lockdown periods for regional elimination of covid some nations have the option of pursuing a policy of complete elimination of covid instead of a policy of flattening the curve so that the load the dis ease places on medical facilities is bearable a policy of elimination requires a rather onerous lockdown as the goal of elimination is approached it is therefore important that there be an informed trade off between the risk of disease re emergence and the duration of the lockdown here it is shown that an important factor in assessing this trade off is the distribution of secondary cases not just the expected value of this distribution r it is shown that a distribution in which super spreaders are more prominent in the epidemiology allows for an earlier release from lockdown with reasonable safety despite some probability of asymptomatic cases there is some evidence to support such a distribution for covid analytical calculations and simulations show that once there is only one recognised case in some subregion release from lockdown will be reasonably safe after just one or two further incubation periods

Text: topological dynamics of the south korea mers cov spread on contact networks network analysis to examine infectious contact relations provides an important means to uncover the topologies of individual infectious contact networks this study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak in korea we present several distinct features of mers transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment the results indicate that a few super spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary thus the infectious contact network exhibited small world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths in addition nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common source outbreak followed by secondary person to person transmission of the disease based on the results we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics

Text: ace coding variants a potential x linked risk factor for covid disease viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic sars cov infection the cause of covid disease viral protein variants have attracted research interest however little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as hiv infection and malaria infestation the fact that the human ace protein is encoded on the x chromosome means that males who carry rare ace coding variants will express those variants in all ace expressing cells whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early x inactivation events this sex based difference in ace expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic sars cov infection to covid here we present theoretical modelling of rare ace coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ace to the sars cov spike protein exist in people though the rs p lys arg allele is found in in ashkenazi jewish males and in in non finnish european males this allele is found at higher frequencies in females furthermore the class of missense ace alleles predicted to affect sars cov binding are found in aggregate among and of ashkenazi males and females respectively as well as in and of european males and females outside of finland these alleles are rarer in other population groups and almost absent from east asians genotyped to date though we are aware that full genome wide and exome wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to sars cov fully we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical sars cov diseases such as asymptomatic super spreaders if any are identified and in neonatal paediatric onset covid disease even relatively rare susceptibility factors or fewer carriers may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections a small number of asymptomatic carriers or a small number of super spreaders or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care can magnify the medical social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size the speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts

Text: identifying influential spreaders of epidemics on community networks an efficient strategy for the identification of influential spreaders that could be used to control epidemics within populations would be of considerable importance generally populations are characterized by its community structures and by the heterogeneous distributions of weak ties among nodes bridging over communities a strategy for community networks capable of identifying influential spreaders that accelerate the spread of disease is here proposed in this strategy influential spreaders serve as target nodes this is based on the idea that in k shell decomposition weak ties and strong ties are processed separately the strategy was used on empirical networks constructed from online social networks and results indicated that this strategy is more accurate than other strategies its effectiveness stems from the patterns of connectivity among neighbors and it successfully identified the important nodes in addition the performance of the strategy remained robust even when there were errors in the structure of the network

Text: multi chain fudan ccdc model for covid a revisit to singapore s case background covid has been impacting on the whole world critically and constantly since late december rapidly increasing infections has raised intense worldwide attention how to model the evolution of covid effectively and efficiently is of great significance for prevention and control methods we propose the multi chain fudan ccdc model based on the original single chain model in to describe the evolution of covid in singapore multi chains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different characteristics we identify parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function results the numerical simulation results exhibit the multi chain model performs well on data fitting though unsteady the increments are they could still fall within the range of fluctuation from simulation results it is predicted by multi chain models that singapore are experiencing a nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak thus stronger measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic conclusion the multi chain fudan ccdc model provides an effective way to early detect the appearance of imported infectors and super spreaders and forecast a second outbreak it can also explain the data in those countries where the single chain model shows deviation from the data

Text: testing for covid willful ignorance or selfless behavior widespread testing is key to controlling the spread of covid but should we worry about self selection bias in the testing the recent literature on willful ignorance says we should people often avoid health information in the context of covid such willful ignorance can bias testing data furthermore willful ignorance often arises when selfish wants conflict with social benefits which might be particularly likely for potential super spreaders people with many social interactions given people who test positive are urged to self isolate for two weeks we design a survey in which participants n choose whether to take a costless covid test we find that would take a test surprisingly the people most likely to widely spread covid the extraverts others who meet more people in their daily lives and younger people are the most willing to take a test people s ability to financially or emotionally sustain self isolation does not matter to their decision we conclude that people are selfless in their decision to test for covid our results are encouraging they imply that covod testing may succeed in targeting those who generate the largest social benefits from self isolation if infected which strengthens the case for widespread testing

Text: generality of endemic prevalence formulae abstract in simple infection models the susceptible proportion s in endemic equilibrium is related to the basic reproduction number r by s r we investigate the extent to which this relationship remains valid under more realistic modelling assumptions in particular we relax the biologically implausible assumptions that individuals lifetimes and infectious periods follow exponential distributions allow a general recruitment process allow for multiple stages of infection and consider extension to a multigroup model in which the groups may represent for instance spatial heterogeneity or the existence of super spreaders for a homogeneous population we find that i the susceptible proportion is s r e where r e is a modified reproduction number equal to r only in certain circumstances ii the proportions of the population in each stage of infection are proportional to the expected time spent by an infected individual in that stage before recovery or death we demonstrate robustness of the formula s r for many human infections by noting conditions under which r e is approximately equal to r while pointing out other circumstances under which this approximation fails for heterogeneous populations the formula s r does not hold in general but we are able to exhibit symmetry conditions under which it is valid
