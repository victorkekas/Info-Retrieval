Text: the end of social confinement and covid re emergence risk the lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions for sars cov raises the possibility of covid recurrence we explore different post confinement scenarios by using a stochastic modified seir susceptible exposed infectious recovered model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period and also incorporates time decaying effects due to potential loss of acquired immunity people s increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of non pharmaceutical interventions our results suggest that lockdowns should remain in place for at least days to prevent epidemic growth as well as a potentially larger second wave of sars cov cases occurring within months the best case scenario should also gradually incorporate workers in a daily proportion at most higher than during the confinement period we show that decaying immunity and particularly awareness and behaviour have significant effects on both the current wave of infection and on preventing covid re emergence social distancing and individual non pharmaceutical interventions could potentially remove the need for lockdowns

Text: viral deubiquitinases role in evasion of anti viral innate immunity host anti viral innate immune signalling pathways are regulated by a variety of post translation modifications including ubiquitination which is critical to regulate various signalling pathways for synthesis of anti viral molecules a homeostasis of host immune responses induced due to viral infection and further ubiquitination is maintained by the action of deubiquitinases dub infecting viruses utilize the process of deubiquitination for tricking host immune system wherein viral dubs compete with host dubs for inhibition of innate immune anti viral signalling pathways which instead of maintaining an immune homeostasis bring about virus mediated pathogenesis this suggests that viruses co evolve with their hosts to acquire similar machinery for tricking immune surveillance and establishing infection

Text: modeling the post containment elimination of transmission of covid roughly six months into the covid pandemic many countries have managed to contain the spread of the virus by means of strict containment measures including quarantine tracing and isolation of patients as well strong restrictions on population mobility here we propose an extended seir model to explore the dynamics of containment and then explore scenarios for the local extinction of the disease we present both the deterministic and stochastic version fo the model and derive the r and the probability of local extinction after relaxation elimination of transmission of containment p we show that local extinctions are possible without further interventions with reasonable probability as long as the number of active cases is driven to single digits and strict control of case importation is maintained the maintenance of defensive behaviors such as using masks and avoiding agglomerations are also important factors we also explore the importance of population immunity even when above the herd immunity threshold

Text: covid immunity certificates science ethics policy and law there is much discussion of adopting covid immunity certificates to allow those proven to have antibodies to the sars cov virus that causes covid to resume normal life and help restart the economy this article points out issues that must be considered before adopting any such program these issues fall into six categories the uncertain science of covid immunity the questionable quality of covid antibody tests practical problems with issuing such certificates deciding how the certificates might be used and ethical and social issues they would raise especially fairness and self infection and potential legal barriers it does not ultimately take a position on whether some narrow covid immunity plans should be adopted concluding that the answer depends on too many currently unknown conditions but it seventh part makes recommendations to decision makers who might consider implementing such programs

Text: humoral immune response and prolonged pcr positivity in a cohort of sars cov patients in the new york city region background severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov has caused a global pandemic the percentage of infected individuals who seroconvert is still an open question in addition it has been shown in some individuals that viral genome can still be detected at considerable time post symptom resolution here we investigated both seroconversion and pcr positivity in a large cohort of convalescent serum donors in new york city methods individuals with confirmed or suspected sars cov infection were screened via pcr for presence of viral genome and via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for presence of anti sars cov spike antibodies results all but three confirmed sars cov patients seroconverted to the sars cov spike while only of suspected sars cov patients seroconverted pcr positivity was detected up to days from symptom resolution conclusions here we show that the vast majority of confirmed covid patients seroconvert potentially providing immunity to reinfection we also report that in a large proportion of individuals viral genome can be detected via pcr in the upper respiratory tract for weeks post symptom resolution but it is unclear if this signal represents infectious virus

Text: the benefits of peer transparency in safe workplace operation post pandemic lockdown the benefits both in terms of productivity and public health are investigated for different levels of engagement with the test trace and isolate procedures in the context of a pandemic in which there is little or no herd immunity simple mathematical modelling is used in the context of a single relatively closed workplace such as a factory or back office where in normal operation each worker has lengthy interactions with a fixed set of colleagues a discrete time seir model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent covid pandemic in the uk during a post peak phase including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment two kinds of worker are assumed transparents who regularly test share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease and opaques who do none of these moreover the simulations are constructed as a playable model in which the transparency level disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user the model is analysed in the continuum limit all simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in maximising productivity and minimising overall infection rates based on these findings public policy implications are discussed on how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace and simple recommendations are made
