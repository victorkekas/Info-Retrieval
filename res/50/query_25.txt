Text: development and validation of chest ct based imaging biomarkers for early stage covid screening coronavirus disease covid is currently a global pandemic and the early screening of covid is one of the key factors for covid control and treatment here we developed and validated chest ct based imaging biomarkers for covid patient screening we identified the vasculature like signals from ct images and found that compared to healthy and community acquired pneumonia cap patients the covid patients revealed significantly higher abundance of these signals furthermore unsupervised feature learning leads to the discovery of clinical relevant imaging biomarkers from the vasculature like signals for accurate and sensitive covid screening that has been double blindly validated in an independent hospital sensitivity specificity auc our findings could open a new avenue to assist screening of covid patients

Text: imaging biomarkers in acute ischemic stroke trials a systematic review background and purpose imaging biomarkers are increasingly used to provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke however this approach of routinely using imaging biomarkers to inform treatment decisions has yet to be translated into successful randomized trials the aim of this study was to systematically review the use of imaging biomarkers in randomized controlled trials in patients with acute ischemic stroke exploring the purposes for which the imaging biomarkers were used materials and methods we performed a systematic review of imaging biomarkers used in randomized controlled trials of acute ischemic stroke in which a therapeutic intervention was trialed within hours of symptom onset data bases searched included medline embase strokecenter org and the virtual international stroke trials archive results eighty four studies met the criteria of which used imaging to select patients for subgroup analysis and as an outcome measure imaging biomarkers were broadly used for purposes there was marked heterogeneity in the definitions and uses of imaging biomarkers and significant publication bias among post hoc analyses conclusions imaging biomarkers offer the opportunity to refine the trial cohort by minimizing participant variation to decrease sample size and to personalize treatment approaches for those who stand to benefit most however within imaging modalities there has been little consistency between stroke trials greater effort to prospectively use consistent imaging biomarkers should help improve the development of novel treatment strategies in acute stroke and improve comparison between studies

Text: prognostic hemostasis biomarkers in acute ischemic stroke objectives the prediction of patients at risk for poor clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke remains challenging an imbalance of coagulation factors may play an important role in progression and prognosis of these patients in this systematic review we assessed the current literature on hemostasis biomarkers and the association with poor clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke approach and results a systematic search of embase medline cochrane library web of science and google scholar was performed on studies reporting on hemostasis biomarkers and clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke studies were considered eligible if blood samples were collected within hours after symptom onset additionally clinical outcome should be assessed using a disability score barthel index or modified rankin scale methodological quality of included studies was assessed with an adapted version of the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies questionnaire a total of articles were read full text and studies were considered eligible for inclusion reporting on different hemostasis biomarkers no single biomarker appeared to be effective in predicting poor clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients conclusions based on current literature no clear recommendations can be provided on which hemostasis biomarkers are a predictor of clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke however some biomarkers show promising results and need to be further investigated and validated in large populations with clear defined study designs

Text: a systematic review of biomarkers multivariately associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome development and mortality background heterogeneity of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards could be reduced by identification of biomarker based phenotypes the set of ards biomarkers to prospectively define these phenotypes remains to be established objective to provide an overview of the biomarkers that were multivariately associated with ards development or mortality data sources we performed a systematic search in embase medline web of science cochrane central and google scholar from inception until march study selection studies assessing biomarkers for ards development in critically ill patients at risk for ards and mortality due to ards adjusted in multivariate analyses were included data extraction and synthesis we included studies for ards development patients at risk for ards and for ards mortality patients with ards these studies were too heterogeneous to be used in a meta analysis as time until outcome and the variables used in the multivariate analyses varied widely between studies after qualitative inspection high plasma levels of angiopoeitin and receptor for advanced glycation end products rage were associated with an increased risk of ards development none of the biomarkers plasma angiopoeitin c reactive protein interleukin rage surfactant protein d and von willebrand factor was clearly associated with mortality conclusions biomarker data reporting and variables used in multivariate analyses differed greatly between studies angiopoeitin and rage in plasma were positively associated with increased risk of ards development none of the biomarkers independently predicted mortality therefore we suggested to structurally investigate a combination of biomarkers and clinical parameters in order to find more homogeneous ards phenotypes prospero identifier prospero crd

Text: diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for parkinson s disease a pathogenetically based approach abstract the inaccuracy of the early diagnosis of parkinson s disease pd has been a major incentive for studies aimed at the identification of biomarkers brain derived cerebrospinal fluid csf proteins are potential biomarkers considering the major role that proteins play in pd pathogenesis in this review we discuss the current hypotheses about the pathogenesis of pd and identify the most promising candidate biomarkers among the csf proteins studied so far the list of potential markers includes proteins involved in various pathogenetic processes such as oxidative stress and protein aggregation this list will undoubtedly grow in the near future by application of csf proteomics and subsequent validation of identified proteins probably a single biomarker will not suffice to reach high sensitivity and specificity because pd is pathogenetically heterogeneous and shares etiological factors with other neurodegenerative diseases furthermore identified candidate biomarkers will have to be thoroughly validated before they can be implemented as diagnostic aids
