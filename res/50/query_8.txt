Text: estimation of covid under reporting in brazilian states through sari due to its impact covid has been stressing the academy to search for curing mitigating or controlling it however when it comes to controlling there are still few studies focused on under reporting estimates it is believed that under reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and if not considered can cause significant misinformation therefore the objective of this work is to estimate the under reporting of cases and deaths of covid in brazilian states using data from the infogripe on notification of severe acute respiratory infection sari the methodology is based on the concepts of inertia and the use of event detection techniques to study the time series of hospitalized sari cases the estimate of real cases of the disease called novelty is calculated by comparing the difference in sari cases in after covid with the total expected cases in recent years to derived from a seasonal exponential moving average the results show that under reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in brazil

Text: the covid sars cov uncertainty tripod in brazil assessments on model based predictions with large under reporting the covid pandemic sars cov virus is the defying global health crisis of our time the absence of mass testing and the relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals causes the available data of the covid pandemic in brazil to be largely under reported regarding the number of infected individuals and deaths we propose an adapted susceptible infected recovered sir model which explicitly incorporates the under reporting and the response of the population to public policies such as confinement measures widespread use of masks etc to cast short term and long term predictions large amounts of uncertainty could provide misleading models and predictions in this paper we discuss the role of uncertainty in these prediction which is illustrated regarding three key aspects first assuming that the number of infected individuals is under reported we demonstrate an anticipation regarding the peak of infection furthermore while a model with a single class of infected individuals yields forecasts with increased peaks a model that considers both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals suggests a decrease of the peak of symptomatic second considering that the actual amount of deaths is larger than what is being register then demonstrate the increase of the mortality rates third when consider generally under reported data we demonstrate how the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change qualitatively and quantitatively we also investigate the effect of the covid under reporting tripod i e the under reporting in terms of infected individuals of deaths and the true mortality rate if two of these factors are known the remainder can be inferred as long as proportions are kept constant the proposed approach allows one to determine the margins of uncertainty by assessments on the observed and true mortality rates

Text: anticipating epidemic transitions with imperfect data epidemic transitions are an important feature of infectious disease systems as the transmissibility of a pathogen increases the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks one proposed method to anticipate this transition are early warning signals ews summary statistics which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached although theoretically predicted their mathematical basis does not take into account the nature of epidemiological data which are typically aggregated into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error the viability of ews for epidemic transitions therefore remains uncertain here we demonstrate that most ews can predict emergence even when calculated from imperfect data we quantify performance using the area under the curve auc statistic a measure of how well an ews distinguishes between numerical simulations of an emerging disease and one which is stationary values of the auc statistic are compared across a range of different reporting scenarios we find that different ews respond to imperfect data differently the mean variance and first differenced variance all perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed the autocorrelation autocovariance and decay time perform well provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than the serial interval and reporting error is not highly overdispersed the coefficient of variation skewness and kurtosis are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence overall we find that seven of ten ews considered perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios we conclude that imperfect epidemiological data is not a barrier to using ews for many potentially emerging diseases

Text: retention in hiv care during pregnancy and the postpartum period in the option b era systematic review and meta analysis of studies in africa background under option b guidelines for prevention of mother to child transmission of hiv pregnant and breastfeeding women initiate antiretroviral therapy for lifelong use the objectives of this study were to synthesize data on retention in care over time in option b programs in africa and to identify factors associated with retention in care methods pubmed embase and african index medicus were systematically searched from january to june pooled estimates of the proportion of women retained were generated and factors associated with retention were analyzed thematically results thirty five articles were included in the final review reported retention rates n and reported factors associated with retention pooled estimates of retention were confidence interval to at months for studies reporting months of follow up and confidence interval to at months for studies reporting months of follow up data on undocumented clinic transfers were largely absent risk factors for poor retention included younger age initiating antiretroviral therapy on the same day as diagnosis initiating during pregnancy versus breastfeeding and initiating late in the pregnancy retention was compromised by stigma fear of disclosure and lack of social support conclusions retention rates in prevention of mother to child transmission under option b were below those of the general adult population necessitating interventions targeting the complex circumstances of women initiating care under option b improved and standardized procedures to track and report retention are needed to accurately represent care engagement and capture undocumented transfers within the health system

Text: association between eczema and major cardiovascular outcomes in population based studies a systematic review protocol introduction chronic inflammatory diseases such as eczema also known as atopic dermatitis have been inconsistently linked to cardiovascular disease and stroke in both mechanistic and epidemiological studies there is a need to review the existing epidemiological data examining the association between eczema and major cardiovascular outcomes including angina myocardial infarction coronary revascularisation heart failure cardiac arrhythmias stroke and cardiovascular death in order to improve our understanding of the comorbidities of eczema methods and analysis we will systematically review population based studies including cohort case control and cross sectional studies reporting on the association between eczema and cardiovascular outcomes we will search medline embase and global health from their date of inception to april using a comprehensive search strategy formulated with the help of a librarian two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts in duplicate followed by independent data extraction and quality assessment we will group studies by the cardiovascular outcome under study and synthesise them narratively if sufficient numbers of homogeneous studies are returned we will perform meta analyses to obtain pooled effect estimates preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analysis will be used to inform the reporting of this study trial registration number crd

Text: considerations for pharmacoepidemiological analyses in the sars cov pandemic the coronavirus disease covid pandemic has triggered several hypotheses regarding use of specific medicines and risk of infection as well as prognosis under these unique circumstances rapid answers require quick engagement in data collection and analyses however appropriate design and conduct of pharmacoepidemiologic studies are needed to generate valid and reliable evidence in this paper endorsed by the international society for pharmacoepidemiology we provide methodological considerations for the conduct of pharmacoepidemiological studies in relation to the pandemic across eight domains timeliness of evidence including the need to prioritise some questions over others in the acute phase of the pandemic the need to align observational and interventional research on efficacy the specific challenges related to real time epidemiology during an ongoing pandemic what design to use to answer a specific question considerations on the definition of exposures what covariates to collect considerations on the definition of outcomes and the need for transparent reporting

Text: an empirical estimate of the infection fatality rate of covid from the first italian outbreak background the coronavirus covid pandemic has been spread ing globally for months yet the infection fatality ratio of the disease is still uncertain this is partly because of inconsistencies in testing and death reporting standards across countries our purpose is to provide accurate estimates which do not rely on testing and death count data directly but only use population level statistics methods we collected demographic and death records data from the italian institute of statistics we focus on the area in italy that experienced the initial outbreak of covid and estimated a bayesian model fitting age stratified mortality data from and previous years we also assessed the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative assumptions on the proportion of population infected findings we estimate an overall infection fatality rate of credible interval cri as well as large differences by age with a low infection fatality rate of for under year old cri and a substantially higher cri for people above years of age in our sensitivity analysis we found that even under extreme assumptions our method delivered useful information for instance even if only of the population were infected the infection fatality rate would not rise above for people under interpretation our empirical estimates based on population level data show a sharp difference in fatality rates between young and old people and firmly rule out overall fatality ratios below in populations with more than over years old

Text: electron microscopic reporting of gastrointestianal viruses in the united kingdom we examined some epidemiological features of the viruses associated with gastrointestinal illness using national data reported by electron microscopists in the united kingdom during the years analyzed a total of positive detections of astroviruses caliciviruses coronaviruses and small round structured viruses srsvs were reported in year of this period rotaviruses were reported more than of the astroviruses and caliciviruses were detected in children under years of age while coronaviruses and srsvs were detected in adults as well as children detections of astroviruses increased in the winter and were infrequent during the summer a seasonal pattern similar to that observed for rotaviruses there was some variability between reporting regions in rates of detection of fecal viruses we have attempted to identify the reasons for this we make suggestions for improving the detection of human fecal viruses and we recognize the need for continued surveillance of these agents
