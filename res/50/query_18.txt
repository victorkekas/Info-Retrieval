Text: do face masks create a false sense of security a covid dilemma face masks have become an emblem of the public response to covid with many governments mandating their use in public spaces the logic is that face masks are low cost and might help prevent some transmission however from the start the assumption that face masks are low cost was questioned early on there were warnings of the opportunity cost of public use of medical masks given shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers this led to recommendations for cloth masks and other face coverings with little evidence of their ability to prevent transmission however there may also be a high cost to these recommendations if people rely on face masks in place of other more effective ways to break transmission such as staying home we use safegraph smart device location data to show that the representative american in states that have face mask mandates spent minutes less time at home and increase visits to a number of commercial locations following the mandate since the reproductive rate of sar cov the pathogen that causes covid is hovering right around one such substitution behavior could be the difference between controlling the epidemic and a resurgence of cases

Text: fast and easy disinfection of coronavirus contaminated face masks using ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator face masks are one of the currently available options for preventing the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov which has caused the pandemic however with the increasing demand for protection face masks are becoming limited in stock and the concerned individuals and healthcare workers from many countries are now facing the issue of the reuse of potentially contaminated masks although various technologies already exist for the sterilization of medical equipment most of them are not applicable for eliminating virus from face masks thus there is an urgent need to develop a fast and easy method of disinfecting contaminated face masks in this study using a human coronavirus hcov e as a surrogate for sars cov contamination on face masks we show that the virus loses its infectivity to a human cell line mrc when exposed for a short period of time min to ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator scanning electron microscopy and particulate filtration efficiency pfe tests revealed that there was no structural or functional deterioration observed in the face masks even after they underwent excessive exposure to ozone five minute exposures interestingly for face masks exposed to ozone gas for min the amplification of hcov e rna by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction suggested a loss of infectivity under the effect of ozone primarily owing to the damage caused to viral envelopes or envelope proteins ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard to reach surfaces including the fabric structure of face masks these results suggest that it may be possible to rapidly disinfect contaminated face masks using a plasma generator in a well ventilated place

Text: does collective interest or self interest motivate mask usage as a preventive measure against covid the revised guidance on masks from public health officials has been one of the most significant covid policy reversals to date statements made at the outset of the pandemic including those from the world health organization who the united states surgeon general and the chief public health officer of canada all actively discouraged asymptomatic members of the general public from wearing masks however on april the united states center for disease control and prevention cdc issued new recommendations that called for nonmedical masks such as cloth face coverings to be worn in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain adams canadian public health officials quickly followed with their own guidance for wearing nonmedical masks or face coverings when out in public however they have stressed that doing so is optional for asymptomatic persons and should be seen as a complement to existing precautionary measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene particularly in cases where physical distancing may not be feasible public health agency of canada emphasis was placed on nonmedical masks serving not to protect the wearer but rather others who come within close proximity of the wearer echoing her public statements on the matter canada s chief public health officer tweeted that w earing a non medical mask in public settings has not been proven to add any protection to the person wearing it but it can be an additional way to prevent spread from an infected person to others tam

Text: masks for prevention of respiratory virus infections including sars cov in health care and community settings a living rapid review background recommendations on masks for preventing coronavirus disease covid vary purpose to examine the effectiveness of n surgical and cloth masks in community and health care settings for preventing respiratory virus infections and effects of reuse or extended use of n masks data sources multiple electronic databases including the world health organization covid database and medrxiv preprint server through april surveillance through june and reference lists study selection randomized trials of masks and risk for respiratory virus infection including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and observational studies of mask use and coronavirus infection risk were included new evidence will be incorporated by using living review methods data extraction one reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations a second reviewer provided verification data synthesis studies randomized controlled trials and observational studies participants were included no study evaluated reuse or extended use of n masks evidence on sars cov was limited to observational studies with serious limitations community mask use was possibly associated with decreased risk for sars cov infection in observational studies in high or moderate risk health care settings observational studies found that risk for infection with sars cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus probably decreased with mask use versus nonuse and possibly decreased with n versus surgical mask use randomized trials in community settings found possibly no difference between n versus surgical masks and probably no difference between surgical versus no mask in risk for influenza or influenza like illness but compliance was low in health care settings n and surgical masks were probably associated with similar risks for influenza like illness and laboratory confirmed viral infection clinical respiratory illness had inconsistency bothersome symptoms were common limitations there were few sars cov studies observational studies have methodological limitations and the review was done by using streamlined methods conclusion evidence on mask effectiveness for respiratory infection prevention is stronger in health care than community settings n respirators might reduce sars cov risk versus surgical masks in health care settings but applicability to sars cov is uncertain primary funding source agency for healthcare research and quality
