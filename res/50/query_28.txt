Text: a randomized trial of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for covid background coronavirus disease covid occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov for persons who are exposed the standard of care is observation and quarantine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after sars cov exposure is unknown methods we conducted a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial across the united states and parts of canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis we enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed covid at a distance of less than ft for more than minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield high risk exposure or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield moderate risk exposure within days after exposure we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine mg once followed by mg in to hours then mg daily for additional days the primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory confirmed covid or illness compatible with covid within days results we enrolled asymptomatic participants overall of the participants of reported a high risk exposure to a confirmed covid contact the incidence of new illness compatible with covid did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine of and those receiving placebo of the absolute difference was percentage points confidence interval to p side effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo vs but no serious adverse reactions were reported conclusions after high risk or moderate risk exposure to covid hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with covid or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within days after exposure funded by david baszucki and jan ellison baszucki and others clinicaltrials gov number nct

Text: potential use of hydroxychloroquine ivermectin and azithromycin drugs in fighting covid trends scope and relevance alarming situation has been caused due to the emergence of covid infection around the world there is an urgency of developing a therapeutic strategy in order to control the spread of covid towards that initiative potential drugs like hydroxychloroquine ivermectin and azithromycin have been tested by diverse group of researchers worldwide for their potential against novel coronavirus the present report presents together the comprehensive knowledge derived from the major researches about the above drugs altogether in context of the current health emergency around the world hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were known to act by creating the acidic environment and inhibiting the importin imp ß mediated viral import azithromycin was found to act similar to the hydroxychloroquine as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base all the three categories of drugs seemed to potentially act against novel coronavirus infection however their efficacies need to be studied in detail individually and in combination in vivo in order to combat covid infection

Text: simulated assessment of pharmacokinetically guided dosing for investigational treatments of pediatric patients with coronavirus disease importance children of all ages appear susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection to support pediatric clinical studies for investigational treatments of coronavirus disease covid pediatric specific dosing is required objective to define pediatric specific dosing regimens for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir for covid treatment design setting and participants pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation were used to extrapolate investigated adult dosages toward children march april physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was used to inform pediatric dosing for hydroxychloroquine for remdesivir pediatric dosages were derived using allometric scaling with age dependent exponents dosing simulations were conducted using simulated pediatric and adult participants based on the demographics of a white us population interventions simulated drug exposures following a day course of hydroxychloroquine mg every hours doses followed by mg every hours doses and a single mg intravenous dose of remdesivir were computed for simulated adult participants a simulation based dose ranging study was conducted in simulated children exploring different absolute and weight normalized dosing strategies main outcomes and measures the primary outcome for hydroxychloroquine was average unbound plasma concentrations for treatment days additionally unbound interstitial lung concentrations were simulated for remdesivir the primary outcome was plasma exposure area under the curve to infinity following single dose administration results for hydroxychloroquine the physiologically based pharmacokinetic model analysis included and simulated white adult and pediatric participants respectively and supported weight normalized dosing for children weighing less than kg geometric mean simulated average unbound plasma concentration values among children within different developmental age groups ng ml were congruent to adults ng ml simulated unbound hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung interstitial fluid mirrored those in unbound plasma and were notably lower than in vitro concentrations needed to mediate antiviral activity for remdesivir the analysis included and simulated adult and pediatric participants respectively the proposed pediatric dosing strategy supported weight normalized dosing for participants weighing less than kg geometric mean simulated plasma area under the time curve to infinity values among children within different developmental age groups ng h ml were similar to adults ng h ml conclusions and relevance this analysis provides pediatric specific dosing suggestions for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir and raises concerns regarding hydroxychloroquine use for covid treatment because concentrations were less than those needed to mediate an antiviral effect
