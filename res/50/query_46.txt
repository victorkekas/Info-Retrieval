Text: routine antiemetic prophylaxis with dexamethasone during covid should oncologists reconsider the ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus type sars cov also known as covid has caused unprecedented strain on the global healthcare system causing thousands of deaths worldwide patients with underlying conditions such as cancer are at substantial risk of acquiring and dying from this novel coronavirus numerous reports have shown that infection with sars cov causes depletion of b and t lymphocytes including cd and cd t cells and is associated with severe illness and death and that patients with higher lymphocyte levels may have better outcomes dexamethasone a widely prescribed antiemetic for acute and delayed nausea and vomiting from a variety of cancer drugs causes b and t cell depletion which may augment immunosuppression since it seems that lymphocytes are vital in the immune response to novel coronavirus oncologists should reconsider the routine use of prophylactic dexamethasone in uninfected patients to avoid inducing lymphopenia which may increase risk of infection or lead to inferior outcomes if a cancer patient subsequently becomes infected since many cancer drugs and malignant diseases inherently cause lymphopenia further reduction of lymphocytes with dexamethasone should be avoided if possible and if safe and effective alternative antiemetics are available during the covid crisis

Text: globule leukocytes and mast cells in the rat trachea their number distribution and response to compound and dexamethasone globule leukocytes in the epithelium of the rat trachea may be counterparts of mucosal mast cells that are located in the gastrointestinal tract if they are indeed similar to mucosal mast cells globule leukocytes would be expected to decrease in number in rats treated with dexamethasone but not in rats treated with compound an agent which causes non antigenic degranulation of connective tissue mast cells in this study we determined the number and compared the distribution of globule leukocytes and connective tissue mast cells in the tracheas of pathogen free rats we then determined whether the number of these two types of cells changes in rats treated for days with compound dexamethasone a combination of compound and dexamethasone or saline we identified globule leukocytes and mast cells in whole mounts and histological sections of rat tracheas by using a histochemical reaction that demonstrates the chymotrypsin like protease chloroacetate esterase present in mast cell granules using this method we found that aproximately globule leukocytes were present in the epithelium of the trachea these cells were most abundant in the rostral trachea rats treated with dexamethasone had a reduction in the number of globule leukocytes with protease containing granules but rats treated with compound had a normal number of these cells we found some connective tissue mast cells in the same tracheas mast cells were most abundant in the posterior membrane of the caudal trachea and in the lamina propria between cartilaginous rings rats treated with compound had a reduction in mast cells with protease containing granules but rats treated with dexamethasone had a normal complement of mast cells we conclude that globule leukocytes are abundant in the tracheas of healthy rats are similar in morphology and pharmacological responses to mucosal mast cells located in other organs of rats and are more numerous than and have a different distribution than connective tissue mast cells globule leukocytes in the tracheal epithelium may have a role in respiratory defenses similar to that of mucosal mast cells in other organs

Text: mechanism of fibronectin binding to human trabecular meshwork exosomes and its modulation by dexamethasone exosomes are emerging as important mediators of cell matrix interactions by means of specific adhesion proteins changes in the tissue specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid induced glaucoma in the trabecular meshwork exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called invadosomes trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor in this study we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome further we found that exosome fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate dependent consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin heparan sulfate binding annexins a and a in this way dexamethasone treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin a and a per exosome interestingly we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone treated explants together our findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid induced alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients

Text: zika virus infection in dexamethasone immunosuppressed mice demonstrating disseminated infection with multi organ involvement including orchitis effectively treated by recombinant type i interferons background disseminated or fatal zika virus zikv infections were reported in immunosuppressed patients existing interferon signaling receptor deficient mouse models may not be suitable for evaluating treatment effects of recombinant interferons methods we developed a novel mouse model for zikv infection by immunosuppressing balb c mice with dexamethasone results dexamethasone immunosuppressed male mice weeks developed disseminated infection as evidenced by the detection of zikv ns protein expression and high viral loads in multiple organs they had weight loss and high clinical scores soon after dexamethasone withdrawal dpi which warranted euthanasia at dpi viral loads in blood and most tissues at dpi were significantly higher than those at dpi p histological examination revealed prominent inflammatory infiltrates in multiple organs and cd and cd inflammatory cells were seen in the testis these findings suggested that clinical deterioration occurred during viral clearance by host immune response type i interferon treatments improved clinical outcome of mice vs survival conclusions besides virus dissemination inflammation of various tissues especially orchitis may be potential complications of zikv infection with significant implications on disease transmission and male fertility interferon treatment should be considered in patients at high risks for zikv associated complications when the potential benefits outweigh the side effects of treatment

Text: the hyperglycemic response to major noncardiac surgery and the added effect of steroid administration in patients with and without diabetes background the pattern and magnitude of the hyperglycemic response to surgical stress the added effect of low dose steroids and whether these differ in diabetics and nondiabetics remain unclear we therefore tested hypotheses that diabetics show a greater increase from preoperative to intraoperative glucose concentrations than nondiabetics and that steroid administration increases intraoperative hyperglycemia more so in diabetics compared with nondiabetics methods patients scheduled for major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled and randomized to preoperative iv mg dexamethasone or placebo stratified by diagnosis of diabetes patients were part of a larger underlying trial the dexamethasone light anesthesia and tight glucose control delit trial iv insulin was given when glucose concentration exceeded mg dl the primary outcome measure was the change in glucose from the preoperative to maximal intraoperative glucose concentration we also report the time dependent pattern of intraoperative hyperglycemia results ninety patients with diabetes were randomized to dexamethasone and with diabetes were given placebo the mean sd change from preoperative to maximal intraoperative glucose concentration was mg dl in diabetics and mg dl in nondiabetics the mean covariable adjusted change confidence interval in nondiabetics was mg dl more than in diabetics p for all patients combined mean glucose increased slightly from preoperative to incision substantially from incision to surgery midpoint and then remained high and fairly stable through emergence with nondiabetic patients showing a greater increase p for nondiabetics the mean increase in glucose concentration ci was mg dl more in patients given dexamethasone than placebo p however there was no dexamethasone effect in diabetics p conclusions treatment of intraoperative hyperglycemia should account for the hyperglycemic surgical stress response trend depending on the stage of surgery as well as the added effects of steroid administration denying steroid prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting for fear of hyperglycemic response should be reconsidered given the limited effect of steroids on intraoperative blood glucose concentrations
