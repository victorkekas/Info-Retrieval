Text: reducing dexamethasone antiemetic prophylaxis during the covid pandemic recommendations from ontario canada purpose people with cancer face an elevated risk of infection and severe sequelae from covid dexamethasone is commonly used for antiemetic prophylaxis with systemic therapy for cancer however dexamethasone is associated with increased risk of viral and respiratory infections and causes lymphopenia which is associated with worse outcomes during covid infections our purpose was to minimize dexamethasone exposure during antiemetic prophylaxis for systemic therapy for solid tumors during the covid pandemic while maintaining control of nausea and emesis methods we convened an expert panel to systematically review the literature and formulate consensus recommendations results no studies considered the impact of dexamethasone based antiemetic regimens on the risk and severity of covid infection expert consensus recommended modifications to the cancer care ontario antiemetic recommendations conclusion clinicians should prescribe the minimally effective dose of dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis single day dexamethasone dosing is recommended over multi day dosing for regimens with high emetogenic risk excluding high dose cisplatin preferably in combination with palonosetron netupitant and olanzapine for regimens with low emetogenic risk ht antagonists are recommended over dexamethasone

Text: a randomized double blind non inferiority trial of magnesium sulphate versus dexamethasone for prevention of postoperative sore throat after lumbar spinal surgery in the prone position background postoperative sore throat post is a frequent complication of tracheal intubation particularly after surgery in the prone position we designed this study to validate the non inferiority of magnesium sulphate against dexamethasone for prevention of post after lumbar spinal surgery methods one hundred and forty six patients were randomly allocated to receive either magnesium or dexamethasone before anesthetic induction the magnesium group n received magnesium sulphate mg kg followed by mg kg h by continuous infusion until the end of surgery the dexamethasone group n received dexamethasone mg the primary endpoint was the overall incidence of post which was assessed serially over hr postoperatively the predefined margin of non inferiority for magnesium against dexamethasone was results overall incidences of post at rest versus in the magnesium and dexamethasone group respectively p and swallowing versus in the magnesium and dexamethasone group respectively p were not different between the groups the upper limit of the confidence interval which must be lower than the predefined margin of non inferiority to prove the non inferiority of magnesium sulphate against dexamethasone for at rest and swallowing were p and p respectively the incidences and severities of post and hoarseness were also not different between the groups throughout the study period conclusions prophylactic magnesium sulphate appears to be non inferior to dexamethasone for the prevention of post at rest in patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery in the prone position
