Text: phylogenomic proximity and comparative proteomic analysis of sars cov the coronavirus disease covid belongs to the family severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov it can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties resulting in the death of immune compromised patients we performed a phylogenomic and phylogeographic tree from the collected datasets phylogenomic analysis or sequence based phylogeny showed an evolutionary relationship between the geographical strains the phylogenomic tree grouped into two major clades consists of various isolates of sars cov and bat sars like coronavirus bat coronavirus and pangolin coronavirus the phylogenetic neighbor of newly sequenced indian strains accession mt mt was revealed to identify the variations between the ncov strains the results showed keen evidence that sars cov has evolved from bat sars like coronavirus the evolutionary history and comparative proteomic analysis provide a new avenue for the current scientific research related to the coronavirus

Text: origin and cross species transmission of bat coronaviruses in china bats are presumed reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses covs including progenitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov and sars cov the causative agent of covid however the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood we used a bayesian statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat covs including novel cov sequences to study their macroevolution cross species transmission and dispersal in china we find that host switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha than beta covs and more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta covs we show that inter family and genus switching is most common in rhinolophidae and the genus rhinolophus our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of cov evolutionary diversity in china that could help target bat cov discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance finally we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for sars cov in rhinolophus spp bats

Text: an analysis of sars cov using vireport the ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov has resulted in millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths given the current lack of treatments or vaccines available it may be useful to trace the evolu tion and spread of the virus to better develop methods of preventative intervention in this study we analyzed over full genome sequences of human sars cov using novel tool vireport an automated workflow for performing phylogenetic analyses on viral sequences and generating comprehensive molecular epidemiologi cal reports the complete vireport output can be found at https github com mirandajsong vireport sars cov

Text: molecular phylogeny of coronaviruses including human sars cov phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses covs including the human sars associated virus is reconstructed from complete genomes by using our newly developed k string composition approach the relation of the human sars cov to other coronaviruses i e the rooting of the tree is suggested by choosing an appropriate outgroup sars cov makes a separate group closer but still distant from g covs in mammalian host the relation between different isolates of the human sars virus is inferred by first constructing an ultrametric distance matrix from counting sequence variations in the genomes the resulting tree is consistent with clinic relations between the sars cov isolates in addition to a larger variety of coronavirus genomes these results provide phylogenetic knowledge based on independent novel methodology as compared to recent phylogenetic studies on sars cov

Text: amino acid variation analysis of surface spike glycoprotein at in sars cov strains abstract as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov continues to disperse globally with worrisome speed identifying amino acid variations in the virus could help to understand the characteristics of it here we studied sars cov genomes obtained from countries from the nextstrain database and performed phylogenetic tree analysis by clade country and genotype of the surface spike glycoprotein s protein at site we found that virus strains from mainland china were mostly distributed in clade b and clade undefined in the phylogenetic tree with very few found in clade a in contrast clades a one case and a a cases predominantly contained strains from european regions moreover clades a and a a differed significantly from those of mainland china in age of infected population p mean age to although such differences did not exist between the us and mainland china further analysis demonstrated that the variation of the s protein at site qhd p d g was a characteristic of stains in clades a and a a importantly this variation was predicted to have neutral or benign effects on the function of the s protein in addition global quality estimates and d protein structures tended to be different between the two s proteins in summary we identified different genomic epidemiology among sars cov strains in different clades especially in an amino acid variation of the s protein at revealing potential viral genome divergence in sars cov strains

Text: a distinct phylogenetic cluster of indian sars cov isolates from an isolated epidemic covid has now emerged as a global pandemic the availability of genomes in the public domain following the epidemic provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and spread of the sars cov virus across the globe the availability of whole genomes from multiple states in india prompted us to analyse the phylogenetic clusters of genomes in india we performed whole genome sequencing for genomes making a total of genomes from india followed by phylogenetic clustering substitution analysis and dating of the different phylogenetic clusters of viral genomes we describe a distinct phylogenetic cluster clade i a i of sars cov genomes from india which encompasses of all genomes sequenced and deposited in the public domain from multiple states in india globally of genomes which till date could not be mapped to any distinct known cluster fall in this newly defined clade the cluster is characterized by a core set of shared genetic variants c a t k c t a v a v c t and c t p l further the cluster is also characterized by a nucleotide substitution rate of variants per site per year lower than the prevalent a a cluster and predominantly driven by variants in the e and n genes and relative sparing of the s gene epidemiological assessments suggest that the common ancestor emerged in the month of february and possibly resulted in an outbreak followed by countrywide spread as evidenced by the low divergence of the genomes from across the country to the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study characterizing the distinct and predominant cluster of sars cov in india
