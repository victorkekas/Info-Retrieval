Text: explore the possible impact of bcg vaccination policy on the morbidity mortality and recovery rates due to covid infection background the coronavirus disease covid is the new form of an acute infectious respiratory disease and has quickly spread over most continents in the world recently it has been shown that bacille calmette guerin bcg might protect against covid this study aims to investigate the possible correlation between bcg vaccination and morbidity mortality recovery rate associated with covid infection methods data of covid confirmed cases deaths recoveries and population were obtained from https www worldometers info coronavirus accessed on june to have meaningful comparisons among countries mortality and recovery rates we only choose those countries with covid infected cases at least the poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between bcg vaccination and morbidity mortality and recovery rates results among those countries with at least covid infected cases there were countries with bcg vaccination information available the adjusted rates ratio of covid confirmed cases for current bcg vaccination vs non current bcg vaccination was with ci moreover the adjusted odds ratio or of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for current bcg vaccination vs non current bcg vaccination were with ci and with ci respectively conclusions that data in this study show the bcg might provide the protection against covid with consequent less covid infection and deaths and more rapid recovery bcg vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease specific vaccine is developed but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials

Text: factors associated with recovery delay in a sample of patients diagnosed by mers cov rrt pcr a saudi arabian multicenter retrospective study background research evidence exists that poor prognosis is common in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov patients objectives this study estimates recovery delay intervals and identifies associated factors in a sample of saudi arabian patients admitted for suspected mers cov and diagnosed by rrt pcr assay methods a multicenter retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted between september and june and diagnosed by rrt pcr procedures to have mers cov and non mers cov infection in which achieved recovery detailed medical charts were reviewed for each patient who achieved recovery time intervals in days were calculated from presentation to the initial rrt pcr diagnosis diagnosis delay and from the initial rrt pcr diagnosis to recovery recovery delay results the median recovery delay in our sample was days according to the multivariate negative binomial model elderly age mers cov infection icu admission and abnormal radiology findings were associated with longer recovery delay adjusted relative risk arr and respectively camel contact and the presence of respiratory symptoms at presentation were associated with a shorter recovery delay expedited recovery arr and respectively diagnosis delay is a positive predictor for recovery delay r p conclusions the study evidence supports that longer recovery delay was seen in patients of older age mers cov infection icu admission and abnormal radiology findings shorter recovery delay was found in patients who had camel contact and respiratory symptoms at presentation these findings may help us understand clinical decision making on directing hospital resources toward prompt screening monitoring and implementing clinical recovery and treatment strategies

Text: the role of vitamin d in the age of covid a systematic review and meta analysis along with an ecological approach background following emerge of a novel coronavirus from wuhan china in december it has affected the whole world and after months of efforts by the medical communities there is still no specific approach for prevention and treatment against the coronavirus disease covid evidence recommends that vitamin d might be an important supportive agent for the immune system mainly in cytokine response regulation against covid hence we carried out a rapid systematic review and meta analysis along with an ecological investigation in order to maximize the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin d in the covid methods a systematic search was performed in pubmed scopus embase cochrane library web of science and google scholar intitle as well as preprint database of medrxiv biorxiv research square preprints org search engine of sciencedirect and a rapid search through famous journals up to may studies focused on the role of vitamin d in confirmed covid patients were entered into the systematic review along with our main aim to find the second objective correlation of global vitamin d status and covid recovery and mortality we carried out a literature search in pubmed database to identify the national or regional studies reported the vitamin d status globally cma v and spss v were used for data analysis results out of nine studies entered into our systematic review six studies containing participants entered into the meta analysis the meta analysis indicated that of covid patients were suffering from vitamin d deficiency ci and in of patients levels of vitamin d were insufficient ci in regard to our ecological investigation on countries including participants analyses indicated no correlation between vitamin d levels and recovery rate r as well as mortality rate r globally however given latitude a small reverse correlation between mortality rate and vitamin d status was observed throughout the globe r in asia a medium direct correlation was observed for recovery rate r and a significant reveres correlation for mortality rate r with vitamin d status in such patients in europe there were no correlations for both recovery r and mortality rate r in middle east the recovery rate r and mortality rate r showed a medium correlation in north and sought america surprisingly both recovery and mortality rate demonstrated a direct correlation respectively r r in oceania unexpectedly recovery r and mortality r rates were in considerable reverse correlation with vitamin d levels conclusion in this systematic review and meta analysis with an ecological approach we found a high percentage of covid patients who suffer from vitamin d deficiency or insufficiency much more important our ecological investigation resulted in substantial direct and reverse correlations between recovery and mortality rates of covid patients with vitamin d status in different countries considering latitudes a small reverse correlation between vitamin d status and mortality rate was found globally it seems that populations with lower levels of vitamin d might be more susceptible to the novel coronavirus infection nevertheless due to multiple limitations if this study does not allow to quantify a value of the vitamin d with full confidence it allows at least to know what the vitamin d might be and that it would be prudent to invest in this direction through comprehensive large randomized clinical trials

Text: positive rectal swabs in young patients recovered from coronavirus disease covid objectives to investigate the widely concerned issue about positive real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr test results after discharge in patients recovered from coronavirus disease covid methods we identified seven cases of covid who was readmitted to hospital because of positive rt pcr after discharge including three pediatrics and four young adult patients results six patients had positive rectal swabs but negative throat swabs and one patient had positive throat swabs all the patients continued to be asymptomatic and had unchanged chest computed tomography from previous images the time from hospital discharge to positive rt pcr after recovery was days the time from positive to negative rectal swabs was days conclusion the study might suggest the positive rt pcr after recovery did not mean disease relapse or virus reinfection adding rt pcr test of rectal swabs to the criteria for discharge or discontinuation of quarantine might be necessary
