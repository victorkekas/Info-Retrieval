Text: remdesivir in treatment of covid a systematic benefit risk assessment background there is a need to identify effective safe treatments for covid coronavirus disease rapidly given the current ongoing pandemic a systematic benefit risk assessment was designed and conducted to strengthen the ongoing understanding of the benefit risk balance for remdesivir in covid treatment by using a structured method which uses all available data methods the benefit risk action team brat framework was used to assess the overall benefit risk of the use of remdesivir as a treatment for covid compared to standard of care placebo or other treatments we searched pubmed google scholar and government agency websites to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking remdesivir for covid a value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance results several key benefits and risks for use of remdesivir in covid compared to placebo have been identified in one trial the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant vs days hr ci although the study was underpowered in another trial a shorter time to recovery in patients treated with remdesivir was observed vs days with non significant reduced mortality risk vs risk data were only available from one trial this trial reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir comparted to the placebo group however more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared to those patients receiving placebo vs conclusions preliminary clinical trial results suggest a favourable benefit risk profile for remdesivir compared to placebo however there is limited safety data available at the current time the current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit risk assessment

Text: what could remdesivir data tell us about tackling covid in the coming weeks the world will get a sense of whether gilead sciences remdesivir an antiviral developed for ebola is useful against the novel coronavirus with the coronavirus pandemic spiraling during the week of march worldwide infections crossed and deaths exceeded initial results emerging from several late stage studies will be under the microscope but infectious disease experts on the front lines warn that the data are unlikely to clearly answer the question of whether remdesivir works in covid the respiratory illness caused by the sars cov virus those first tests are in the sickest hardest to treat patients moreover antivirals don t have a great track record at taking down coronaviruses which can be a little more sophisticated than your average rna virus still some industry watchers hope the studies signal enough success to convince the us food and drug administration to approve gilead s experimental drug when a new infectious disease threatens

Text: remdesivir the antiviral hope against sars cov remdesivir la esperanza antiviral frente al sars cov on december a pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus sars cov was detected in the city of wuhan china due to the high capacity of diffusion and human infection it has become a new zoonotic pandemic the absence of a vaccine has determined the search for antiviral drugs with the capacity to inhibit the replication of the new virus among them remdesivir an analogue of adenosine is what seems to have a more promising future this drug has shown in vitro and in animals a high capacity to block infection and viral replication with attainable concentrations in human plasma although all studies have been carried out with sars cov and mers cov it seems that by virological and functional analogy remdesivir is one of the few antiviral drugs with proven efficacy however studies and clinical trials in humans are required to know the result of their application in them
