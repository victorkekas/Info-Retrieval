Text: effectiveness and cost effectiveness of public health measures to control covid a modelling study background the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov was first reported in china which caused a respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease covid since its discovery the virus has spread to over countries and claimed more than deaths this study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of various response public health measures method the stochastic agent based model was used to simulate the process of covid outbreak in scenario i imported one case and ii imported four cases with a series of public health measures involving the personal protection isolation and quarantine gathering restriction and community containment the virtual community was constructed following the susceptible latent infectious recovered framework the epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation the main outcomes included avoided infectors cost effectiveness ratios cers and incremental cost effectiveness ratios icers the sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty findings in scenario i and ii the isolation and quarantine averted and humans infected respectively at the cost of us and us both with negative value of icers the joint strategy of personal protection and isolation and quarantine could avert one more case than single isolation and quarantine with additional cost of us and us respectively the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine decreased as lowering quarantine probability and increasing delay time especially in scenario ii when the quarantine probability was less than the number of infections raised sharply when the quarantine delay time reached six days more than a quarter of individuals would be infected in the community the strategy including community containment could protect more lives and was cost effective when the number of imported cases was no less than or the delay time of quarantine was more than five days or the quarantine probability was below based on current assumptions interpretation the isolation and quarantine was the most cost effective intervention however personal protection and isolation and quarantine was the optimal strategy averting more infectors than single isolation and quarantine certain restrictions should be considered such as more initial imported cases longer quarantine delay time and lower quarantine probability
