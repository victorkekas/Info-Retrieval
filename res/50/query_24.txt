Text: coronavirus disease and diabetes the epidemic and the korean diabetes association perspective diabetes has been associated with more severe outcomes and higher mortality in coronavirus disease covid patients compare to morbidity and mortality in patients without diabetes several mechanisms may play a role in this greater morbidity and mortality especially uncontrolled hyperglycemia an impaired immune system pre existing proinflammatory states multiple comorbidities and dysregulated angiotensin converting enzyme signaling thus the diabetes medical community emergently needs to know about covid and its effects on patients with diabetes as they must take precautions to carefully manage these patients during the covid pandemic the korean diabetes association provides some guidance and practical recommendations for the management of diabetes during the pandemic this report provides insight into the association between diabetes and covid proper management of diabetes in patients with covid and an official suggestion by the korean diabetes association for managing the covid outbreak

Text: diabetes and novel coronavirus infection implications for treatment the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov outbreak originating in december has resulted in a worldwide pandemic affecting millions across almost countries people with diabetes appear to develop more severe forms of the disease and to require intensive care unit support and or mechanical ventilation more frequently than those with other underlying medical conditions the mortality rate among people with diabetes is also significantly higher than that among people without diabetes a diagnosis of diabetes is often an indicator of poor underlying metabolic health and frequently people with diabetes have multiple risk factors for severe coronavirus disease covid including cardiovascular and renal disease in this review we discuss the potential biological mechanisms by which sars cov may interact with disease processes implicated in diabetes and discuss how treatments commonly used for people with diabetes may affect covid severity and progression there is currently a lack of evidence from human studies and further trials in this area will prove useful to further expand our understanding of this rapidly developing disease process to improve outcomes for this high risk group of patients electronic supplementary material the online version of this article s contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users

Text: patients with diabetes are at higher risk for severe illness from covid it is currently uncertain whether people with diabetes are at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus disease covid we found that diabetes was associated with an approximately fold increased risk of having severe critical covid illness this association was independent of age sex obesity hypertension and smoking these findings highlight the urgent need for a multidisciplinary team based approach to management of this patient population

Text: individualizing inpatient diabetes management during the coronavirus disease pandemic diabetes is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease covid during this pandemic many hospitals have already become overwhelmed around the world and are rapidly entering crisis mode while there are global efforts to boost personal protective equipment ppe production many centers are improvising care strategies including the implementation of technology to prevent healthcare workers exposures and reduce the waste of invaluable ppe not optimizing glycemic control due to clinical inertia driven by fear or lack of supplies may lead to poor outcomes in patients with diabetes and covid individualized care strategies novel therapeutic regimens and the use of diabetes technology may reduce these barriers however systematic evaluation of these changes in care is necessary to evaluate both patient and community centered outcomes

Text: diabetes epidemiology in the covid pandemic diabetes has been identified as an important risk factor for mortality and rates of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease covid however many recent reports on this topic reflect hurried approaches and have lacked careful epidemiologic design conduct and analysis features of prior studies have posed problems for our understanding of the true contribution of diabetes and other underlying comorbidities to prognosis in covid in this perspective we discuss some of the challenges of interpreting the current literature on diabetes and covid and discuss opportunities for future epidemiologic studies we contend that the covid pandemic is a defining moment for the field of epidemiology and that diabetes epidemiology should play a significant role
