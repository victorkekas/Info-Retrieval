Text: complexities of viral mutation rates many viruses evolve rapidly this is due in part to their high mutation rates mutation rate estimates for over viruses are currently available here we review the population genetics of virus mutation rates we specifically cover the topics of mutation rate estimation the forces that drive the evolution of mutation rates and how the optimal mutation rate can be context dependent

Text: functional analysis of the stem loop s and s structures in the coronavirus utr abstract we designed a series of mutations to separately destabilize two helical stems designated s and s predicted by a covariation based model of the coronavirus utr zust et al mouse hepatitis virus genomes containing three or four nucleotide mutations that destabilize either s or s were viable whereas genomes carrying these mutations in both s and s were not viable a genome carrying these mutations in s and s plus compensatory mutations restoring base pairing yielded a virus with wild type phenotype larger mutations which completely disrupt s or s generated various phenotypes mutations opening up s were lethal disruptions of s generated both viable and lethal mutants genomes carrying the original mutations in s or s plus compensatory mutations restoring base pairing were viable and had robust growth phenotypes these results support the zust model for the coronavirus utr and suggest that the s stem is required for virus viability

Text: prediction of amino acid pairs sensitive to mutations in the spike protein from sars related coronavirus in this study we analyzed the amino acid pairs affected by mutations in two spike proteins from human coronavirus strains e and oc by means of random analysis in order to gain some insight into the possible mutations in the spike protein from sars cov the results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations the larger is the difference between actual and predicted frequencies the higher is the chance of mutation occurring the effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations these findings are identical to our several recent studies i e the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases
