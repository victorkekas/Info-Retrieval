Text: prediction of amino acid pairs sensitive to mutations in the spike protein from sars related coronavirus in this study we analyzed the amino acid pairs affected by mutations in two spike proteins from human coronavirus strains e and oc by means of random analysis in order to gain some insight into the possible mutations in the spike protein from sars cov the results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations the larger is the difference between actual and predicted frequencies the higher is the chance of mutation occurring the effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations these findings are identical to our several recent studies i e the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases

Text: anti frameshifting ligand active against sars coronavirus is resistant to natural mutations of the frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot the coronavirus sars cov causing the covid pandemic uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting prf to control the expression levels of key viral proteins because modulating prf can attenuate viral propagation ligands binding to the viral rna pseudoknot that stimulates prf may prove useful as therapeutics mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic but how they affect prf and the activity of inhibitors is unknown cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the sars cov pseudoknot we studied a panel of mutations in key structural regions most mutations left the prf efficiency unchanged even when base pairing was disrupted but one led to a remarkable three fold decrease suggesting that sars cov propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of prf efficiency than some other viruses examining the effects of one of the few small molecule ligands known to suppress prf significantly in sars cov we found that it did so by similar amounts in all sars cov mutants tested regardless of the basal prf efficiency indicating that the activity of anti frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations these results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting sars cov through modulation of prf

Text: sars cov spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain is subject to negative selection with predicted positive selection mutations covid is a highly contagious disease caused by a novel coronavirus sars cov the interaction between sars cov spike protein and the host cell surface receptor ace is responsible for mediating sars cov infection by analyzing the spike hace interacting surface we predicted many hot spot residues that make major contributions to the binding affinity mutations on most of these residues are likely to be deleterious leading to less infectious virus strains that may suffer from negative selection meanwhile several residues with mostly advantageous mutations have been predicted it is more probable that mutations on these residues increase the transmission ability of the virus by enhancing spike hace interaction so far only a limited number of mutations has been reported in this region however the list of hot spot residues with predicted downstream effects from this study can still serve as a tracking list for sars cov evolution studies coincidentally one advantageous mutation p g s started to surge in the last couple of weeks based on the data submitted to the public domain indicating that virus strains with increased transmission ability may have already spread

Text: a human coronavirus oc variant harboring persistence associated mutations in the s glycoprotein differentially induces the unfolded protein response in human neurons as compared to wild type virus abstract we have reported that human respiratory coronavirus oc hcov oc is neurotropic and neuroinvasive in humans and mice and that neurons are the primary target of infection in mice leading to neurodegenerative disabilities we now report that an hcov oc mutant harboring two persistence associated s glycoprotein point mutations h r and y h induced a stronger unfolded protein response upr and translation attenuation in infected human neurons there was a major contribution of the ire xbp pathway followed by caspase activation and nuclear fragmentation with no significant role of the atf and eif alpha atf pathways our results show the importance of discrete molecular viral s determinants in virus neuronal cell interactions that lead to increased production of viral proteins and infectious particles enhanced upr activation and increased cytotoxicity and cell death as this mutant virus is more neurovirulent in mice our results also suggest that two mutations in the s glycoprotein could eventually modulate viral neuropathogenesis

Text: assessing the impacts of mutations to the structure of covid spike protein via sequential monte carlo proteins play a key role in facilitating the infectiousness of the novel coronavirus a specific spike protein enables this virus to bind to human cells and a thorough understanding of its dimensional structure is therefore critical for developing effective therapeutic interventions however its structure may continue to evolve over time as a result of mutations in this paper we use a data science perspective to study the potential structural impacts due to ongoing mutations in its amino acid sequence to do so we identify a key segment of the protein and apply a sequential monte carlo sampling method to detect possible changes to the space of low energy conformations for different amino acid sequences such computational approaches can further our understanding of this protein structure and complement laboratory efforts

Text: patient derived mutations impact pathogenicity of sars cov the sudden outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov has spread globally with more than patients diagnosed and a death toll of current genomic survey data suggest that single nucleotide variants snvs are abundant however no mutation has been directly linked with functional changes in viral pathogenicity here we report functional characterizations of patient derived viral isolates all of which have at least one mutation importantly these viral isolates show significant variation in cytopathic effects and viral load up to fold differences when infecting vero e cells we observed intrapersonal variation and different mutations in the spike glycoprotein s protein including different snvs that led to the same missense mutation therefore we provide direct evidence that the sars cov has acquired mutations capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity

Text: coronavirus particle assembly primary structure requirements of the membrane protein coronavirus like particles morphologically similar to normal virions are assembled when genes encoding the viral membrane proteins m and e are coexpressed in eukaryotic cells using this envelope assembly assay we have studied the primary sequence requirements for particle formation of the mouse hepatitis virus mhv m protein the major protein of the coronavirion membrane our results show that each of the different domains of the protein is important mutations deletions insertions point mutations in the luminal domain the transmembrane domains the amphiphilic domain or the carboxy terminal domain had effects on the assembly of m into enveloped particles strikingly the extreme carboxy terminal residue is crucial deletion of this single residue abolished particle assembly almost completely most substitutions were strongly inhibitory site directed mutations in the carboxy terminus of m were also incorporated into the mhv genome by targeted recombination the results supported a critical role for this domain of m in viral assembly although the m carboxy terminus was more tolerant of alteration in the complete virion than in virus like particles likely because of the stabilization of virions by additional intermolecular interactions interestingly glycosylation of m appeared not essential for assembly mutations in the luminal domain that abolished the normal o glycosylation of the protein or created an n glycosylated form had no effect mutant m proteins unable to form virus like particles were found to inhibit the budding of assembly competent m in a concentration dependent manner however assembly competent m was able to rescue assembly incompetent m when the latter was present in low amounts these observations support the existence of interactions between m molecules that are thought to be the driving force in coronavirus envelope assembly
