Text: human coronavirus nl associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms in early life coronavirus nl has been identified as a new member of the coronavirus genus but its role as a cause of respiratory disease needs to be established we studied the first episode of lower respiratory tract symptoms in a cohort of healthy neonates nl was identified in of cases and was as frequent as other coronaviruses nl was recovered at the onset of symptoms and was cleared within weeks in half of the cases our data suggests that coronavirus nl causes lower respiratory tract symptoms and is acquired in early life

Text: the role of human coronavirus infection in pediatric acute gastroenteritis since human coronavirus hcov like particles were detected in the stool specimens of acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing enterocolitis children with electron microscopy the relationship between hcov and the pediatric gastrointestinal illness had been recognized in recent years the overall detection rates have been low and have varied by region hcovs have not been considered as the major pathogens in pediatric acute gastroenteritis hcovs detected in children with acute gastroenteritis have included e oc hku nl and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus have also been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in children although digestive tract has been recognized as an infection route it has not been possible to fully investigate the association between hcovs infection and the gastrointestinal symptoms because of the limited number of pediatric cases furthermore pathological features have not been clear till now our knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is limited however diarrhea and vomiting have been seen in pediatric cases particularly in newborns and infants it has been necessary to pay more attention on gastrointestinal transmission to identify the infected children early and avoid the children without apparent or mild symptoms becoming the sources of infection
