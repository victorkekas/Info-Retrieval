Text: brief research report bidirectional impact of imperfect mask use on reproduction number of covid a next generation matrix approach the use of masks as a means of reducing transmission of covid outside healthcare settings has proved controversial masks are thought to have two modes of effect they prevent infection with covid in wearers and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infection we used a simple next generation matrix approach to estimate the conditions under which masks would reduce the reproduction number of covid under a threshold of our model takes into account the possibility of assortative mixing where mask users interact preferentially with other mask users we make key observations masks even with suboptimal efficacy in both prevention of acquisition and transmission of infection could substantially decrease the reproduction number for covid if widely used widespread masking may be sufficient to suppress epidemics where r has been brought close to via other measures e g distancing assortment within populations the tendency for interactions between masked individuals to be more likely than interactions between masked and unmasked individuals would rapidly erode the impact of masks as such mask uptake needs to be fairly universal to have an effect this simple model suggests that widespread uptake of masking could be determinative in suppressing covid epidemics in regions with r t at or near

Text: event specific interventions to minimize covid transmission coronavirus disease covid is a global pandemic with over million cases worldwide currently there is no treatment and no vaccine interventions such as hand washing masks social distancing and social bubbles are used to limit community transmission but it is challenging to choose the best interventions for a given activity here we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings we introduce the concept of event r the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infected individual at an event we obtain a fundamental relationship between event r and four parameters transmission intensity duration of exposure the proximity of individuals and the degree of mixing we use reports of small outbreaks to establish event r and transmission intensity in a range of settings we identify principles that guide whether physical distancing masks and other barriers to transmission or social bubbles will be most effective we outline how this information can be obtained and used to re open economies with principled measures to reduce covid transmission

Text: the effect of mask use on the spread of influenza during a pandemic face masks have traditionally been used in general infection control but their efficacy at the population level in preventing transmission of influenza viruses has not been studied in detail data from published clinical studies indicate that the infectivity of influenza a virus is probably very high so that transmission of infection may involve low doses of virus at low doses the relation between dose and the probability of infection is approximately linear so that the reduction in infection risk is proportional to the reduction in exposure due to particle retention of the mask a population transmission model was set up to explore the impact of population wide mask use allowing estimation of the effects of mask efficacy and coverage fraction of the population wearing masks on the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate we conclude that population wide use of face masks could make an important contribution in delaying an influenza pandemic mask use also reduces the reproduction number possibly even to levels sufficient for containing an influenza outbreak

Text: understanding the impact of face mask usage through epidemic simulation of large social networks evidence from the sars epidemic and h n pandemic shows that face masks can be an effective non pharmaceutical intervention in minimizing the spread of airborne viruses recent studies have shown that using face masks is correlated to an individual s age and gender where females and older adults are more likely to wear a mask than males or youths there are only a few studies quantifying the impact of using face masks to slow the spread of an epidemic at the population level and even fewer studies that model their impact in a population where the use of face masks depends upon the age and gender of the population we use a state of the art agent based simulation to model the use of face masks and quantify their impact on three levels of an influenza epidemic and compare different mitigation scenarios these scenarios involve changing the demographics of mask usage the adoption of mask usage in relation to a perceived threat level and the combination of masks with other non pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing and social distancing our results shows that face masks alone have limited impact on the spread of influenza however when face masks are combined with other interventions such as hand sanitizer they can be more effective we also observe that monitoring social internet systems can be a useful technique to measure compliance we conclude that educating the public on the effectiveness of masks to increase compliance can reduce morbidity and mortality

Text: fast and easy disinfection of coronavirus contaminated face masks using ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator face masks are one of the currently available options for preventing the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov which has caused the pandemic however with the increasing demand for protection face masks are becoming limited in stock and the concerned individuals and healthcare workers from many countries are now facing the issue of the reuse of potentially contaminated masks although various technologies already exist for the sterilization of medical equipment most of them are not applicable for eliminating virus from face masks thus there is an urgent need to develop a fast and easy method of disinfecting contaminated face masks in this study using a human coronavirus hcov e as a surrogate for sars cov contamination on face masks we show that the virus loses its infectivity to a human cell line mrc when exposed for a short period of time min to ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator scanning electron microscopy and particulate filtration efficiency pfe tests revealed that there was no structural or functional deterioration observed in the face masks even after they underwent excessive exposure to ozone five minute exposures interestingly for face masks exposed to ozone gas for min the amplification of hcov e rna by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction suggested a loss of infectivity under the effect of ozone primarily owing to the damage caused to viral envelopes or envelope proteins ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard to reach surfaces including the fabric structure of face masks these results suggest that it may be possible to rapidly disinfect contaminated face masks using a plasma generator in a well ventilated place

Text: do face masks create a false sense of security a covid dilemma face masks have become an emblem of the public response to covid with many governments mandating their use in public spaces the logic is that face masks are low cost and might help prevent some transmission however from the start the assumption that face masks are low cost was questioned early on there were warnings of the opportunity cost of public use of medical masks given shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers this led to recommendations for cloth masks and other face coverings with little evidence of their ability to prevent transmission however there may also be a high cost to these recommendations if people rely on face masks in place of other more effective ways to break transmission such as staying home we use safegraph smart device location data to show that the representative american in states that have face mask mandates spent minutes less time at home and increase visits to a number of commercial locations following the mandate since the reproductive rate of sar cov the pathogen that causes covid is hovering right around one such substitution behavior could be the difference between controlling the epidemic and a resurgence of cases

Text: estimating the effect and cost effectiveness of facemasks in reducing the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in uganda evidence that face masks provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce however face masks are widely used by health workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections it would therefore be reasonable to suggest that consistent widespread use of face masks in the community could prevent further spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in this study we examine public face mask wearing in uganda where a proportion wears masks to protect against acquiring and the other to prevent from transmitting sars cov the objective of this study was to determine what percentage of the population would have to wear face masks to reduce susceptibility to and infectivity of covid in uganda keeping the basic reproduction number below unity and or flattening the curve we used an seiaqrd model for the analysis results show that implementation of facemasks has a relatively large impact on the size of the coronavirus epidemic in uganda we find that the critical mask adherence is per when wear face masks a cost effective analysis shows that utilizing funds to provide public mask to the population has a per capita compounded cost of usd if provision of face masks is done simultaneously with supportive care the per capita compounded cost is usd while for the case of only treatment and no provision of face masks costs each ugandan usd we conclude that since it is hard to achieve a adherence to face masks government might consider provision of face masks in conjunction with provision of care

Text: estimation of effects of contact tracing and mask adoption on covid transmission in san francisco a modeling study the current covid pandemic has spurred concern about what interventions may be effective at reducing transmission the city and county of san francisco imposed a shelter in place order in march followed by use of a contact tracing program and a policy requiring use of cloth face masks we used statistical estimation and simulation to estimate the effectiveness of these interventions in san francisco we estimated that self isolation and other practices beginning at the time of san francisco s shelter in place order reduced the effective reproduction number of covid by ci we estimated the effect of contact tracing on the effective reproduction number to be a reduction of approximately times the fraction of cases that are detected which may be modest if the detection rate is low we estimated the impact of cloth mask adoption on reproduction number to be approximately and note that the benefit of mask adoption may be substantially greater for essential workers and other vulnerable populations residents return to circulating outside the home more often we estimated the effect of those interventions on incidence by simulating counterfactual scenarios in which contact tracing was not adopted cloth masks were not adopted and neither contact tracing nor cloth masks was adopted and found increases in case counts that were modest but relatively larger than the effects on reproduction numbers these estimates and model results suggest that testing coverage and timing of testing and contact tracing may be important and that modest effects on reproduction numbers can nonetheless cause substantial effects on case counts over time

Text: testing the efficacy of homemade masks would they protect in an influenza pandemic objective this study examined homemade masks as an alternative to commercial face masks methods several household materials were evaluated for the capacity to block bacterial and viral aerosols twenty one healthy volunteers made their own face masks from cotton t shirts the masks were then tested for fit the number of microorganisms isolated from coughs of healthy volunteers wearing their homemade mask a surgical mask or no mask was compared using several air sampling techniques results the median fit factor of the homemade masks was one half that of the surgical masks both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers although the surgical mask was times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask conclusion our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals but it would be better than no protection disaster med public health preparedness

Text: impact of population mask wearing on covid post lockdown covid caused by sars cov is a rapidly spreading global pandemic although precise transmission routes and dynamics are unknown sars cov is thought primarily to spread via contagious respiratory droplets unlike with sars cov maximal viral shedding occurs in the early phase of illness and this is supported by models that suggest of transmission events occur from pre and asymptomatic individuals one widely discussed strategy to limit transmission of sars cov particularly from presymptomatic individuals has been population level wearing of masks modelling for pandemic influenza suggests some benefit in reducing total numbers infected with even mask use covid has a higher hospitalization and mortality rate than influenza and the impacts on these parameters and critically at what point in the pandemic trajectory mask use might exert maximal benefit are completely unknown we derived a simplified sir model to investigate the effects of near universal mask use on covid assuming or mask efficacy we decided to model in particular the impact of masks on numbers of critically ill patients and cumulative mortality since these are parameters that are likely to have the most severe consequences in the covid pandemic whereas mask use had a relatively minor benefit on critical care and mortality rates when transmissibility reff was high the reduction on deaths was dramatic as the effective r approached as might be expected after aggressive social distancing measures such as wide spread lockdowns one major concern with covid is its potential to overwhelm healthcare infrastructures even in resource rich settings with one third of hospitalized patients requiring critical care we incorporated this into our model increasing death rates for when critical care resources have been exhausted our simple model shows that modest efficacy of masks could avert substantial mortality in this scenario importantly the effects on mortality became hyper sensitive to mask wearing as the effective r approaches i e near the tipping point of when the infection trajectory is expected to revert to exponential growth as would be expected after effective lockdown our model suggests that mask wearing might exert maximal benefit as nations plan their post lockdown strategies and suggests that mask wearing should be included in further more sophisticated models of the current pandemic
