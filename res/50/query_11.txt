Text: cost effective critical care cost containment and rationing rationing occurs whenever the demand for a good or service exceeds its supply therefore rationing is an inevitable occurrence in medicine and in critical care where the potential demand for effective medical care will exceed supply although there are many strategies to allocate medical resources one that is often considered is based on cost effectiveness cost effectiveness analysis attempts to estimate the value of individual medical treatments in terms of dollars and outcomes allocation of medical treatments based on cost effectiveness analysis requires valid estimates of both the costs and the effectiveness of treatments as well as some overarching body with the authority to enforce allocation based on these analyses limitations of allocation based on cost effectiveness analysis in critical care include difficulties in estimating marginal costs of critical care treatments limited evidence for any treatments with efficacy and the ethical principle of rescuing identifiable lives in imminent risk of death the prospect of a pandemic influenza like infection has stimulated a lot of interest in hypothetical rationing strategies for the intensive care unit none of which has been tested in actual pandemic scenarios given the burden of critical illness and the wide variation in resources a global approach to rationing is untenable the article concludes with a vision of the future of allocation in critical care

Text: ethical allocation of scarce health care resources in the context of the covid crisis the current covid pandemic has the potential to overwhelm the capacity of hospitals and intensive care units in chile and latin america thus local authorities have an ethical obligation to be prepared by implementing pertinent measures to prevent a situation of rationing of scarce healthcare resources and by defining ethically acceptable and socially legitimate criteria for the allocation of these resources this paper responds to recent ethical guidelines issued by a chilean academic institution and discusses the main moral principles for the ethical foundations of criteria for rationing during the present crisis it argues that under exceptional circumstances such as the current pandemic the traditional patient centered morality of medicine needs to be balanced with ethical principles formulated from a public health perspective including the principles of social utility social justice and equity among others the paper concludes with some recommendations regarding how to reach an agreement about rationing criteria and about their implementation in clinical practice
