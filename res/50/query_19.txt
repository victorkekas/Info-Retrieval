Text: hand sanitizers a review of ingredients mechanisms of action modes of delivery and efficacy against coronaviruses background the emergence of the novel virus sars cov has posed unprecedented challenges to public health around the world currently strategies to deal with covid are purely supportive and preventative aimed at reducing transmission an effective and simple method for reducing transmission of infections in the public or healthcare settings is hand hygiene unfortunately little is known regarding the efficacy of hand sanitizers against sars cov methods in this review an extensive literature search was performed to succinctly summarize the primary active ingredients and mechanisms of action of hand sanitizers compare the effectiveness and compliance of gel and foam sanitizers and predict whether alcohol and non alcohol hand sanitizers would be effective against sars cov results most alcohol based hand sanitizers are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses including coronaviruses with what is currently known in the literature one may not confidently suggest one mode of hand sanitizing delivery over the other when hand washing with soap and water is unavailable a sufficient volume of sanitizer is necessary to ensure complete hand coverage and compliance is critical for appropriate hand hygiene conclusions by extrapolating effectiveness of hand sanitizers on viruses of similar structure to sars cov this virus should be effectively inactivated with current hand hygiene products though future research should attempt to determine this directly
