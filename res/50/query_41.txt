Text: are clinicians contributing to excess african american covid deaths unbeknownst to them they may be african americans are overrepresented among reported coronavirus disease covid cases and deaths there are a multitude of factors that may explain the african american disparity in covid outcomes including higher rates of comorbidities while individual level factors predictably contribute to disparate covid outcomes systematic and structural factors have not yet been reported it stands to reason that implicit biases may fuel the racial disparity in covid outcomes to address this racial disparity we must apply a health equity lens and disaggregate data explicitly for african americans as well as other populations at risk for biased treatment in the health care system
