Text: differential expression of covid related genes in european americans and african americans the coronavirus disease covid pandemic has affected african american populations disproportionately in regards to both morbidity and mortality a multitude of factors likely account for this discrepancy gene expression represents the interaction of genetics and environment to elucidate whether levels of expression of genes implicated in covid vary in african americans as compared to european americans we re mine the cancer genome atlas tcga and genotype tissue expression gtex rna seq data multiple genes integral to infection inflammation and immunity are differentially regulated across the two populations most notably f a and f a which encode the hap protein that mediates early endosome movement in huntington s disease are more highly expressed by up to fold in african americans such differences in gene expression can establish prognostic signatures and have critical implications for precision treatment of diseases such as covid we advocate routine inclusion of information such as postal code education level and profession as a proxies for socioeconomic condition and race in the metadata about each individual sampled for sequencing studies this relatively simple change would enable large scale data driven approaches to dissect relationships among race socio economic factors and disease

Text: contemporary and future concepts on hypertension in african americans covid and beyond background cardiovascular disease related mortality is the leading cause of death in the united states with hypertension being the most prevalent and potent risk factor for decades hypertension has disproportionately affected african americans who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure methods current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in african americans in pubmed were reviewed we also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between covid and cardiovascular disease findings while apol has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors these factors include poor diet adverse lifestyle and social determinants hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet weight loss and adequate physical activity when lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension a common occurrence among african americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension pharmacological intervention is indicated the efficacy of renal denervation and the use of sodium glucose cotransporter and aminopeptidase a inhibitors have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension furthermore the recent covid crisis has been particularly devastating among african americans who demonstrate increased incidence and poorer health outcomes related to the disease conclusion the disparities in outcomes which are largely attributable to a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity in addition to adverse environmental and socioeconomic factors highlight the necessity of specialized clinical approaches and programs for african americans to address longstanding barriers to equitable care

Text: are clinicians contributing to excess african american covid deaths unbeknownst to them they may be african americans are overrepresented among reported coronavirus disease covid cases and deaths there are a multitude of factors that may explain the african american disparity in covid outcomes including higher rates of comorbidities while individual level factors predictably contribute to disparate covid outcomes systematic and structural factors have not yet been reported it stands to reason that implicit biases may fuel the racial disparity in covid outcomes to address this racial disparity we must apply a health equity lens and disaggregate data explicitly for african americans as well as other populations at risk for biased treatment in the health care system

Text: pseudo likelihood based logistic regression for estimating covid infection and case fatality rates by gender race and age in california in emerging epidemics early estimates of key epidemiological characteristics of the disease are critical for guiding public policy in particular identifying high risk population subgroups aids policymakers and health officials in combatting the epidemic this has been challenging during the coronavirus disease covid pandemic because governmental agencies typically release aggregate covid data as marginal summary statistics of patient demographics these data may identify disparities in covid outcomes between broad population subgroups but do not provide comparisons between more granular population subgroups defined by combinations of multiple demographics we introduce a method that overcomes the limitations of aggregated summary statistics and yields estimates of covid infection and case fatality rates key quantities for guiding public policy related to the control and prevention of covid for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics our approach uses pseudo likelihood based logistic regression to combine aggregate covid case and fatality data with population level demographic survey data to estimate infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics we illustrate our method on california covid data to estimate test based infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups defined by gender age and race and ethnicity our analysis indicates that in california males have higher test based infection rates and test based case fatality rates across age and race ethnicity groups with the gender gap widening with increasing age although elderly infected with covid are at an elevated risk of mortality the test based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age latinx and african americans have higher test based infection rates than other race ethnicity groups the subgroups with the highest test based case fatality rates are african american male multi race male asian male african american female and american indian or alaska native male indicating that african americans are an especially vulnerable california subpopulation

Text: socioeconomic correlates of obesity in african american and caribbean black men and women the high prevalence of obesity among black americans warrants additional investigation into its relationship with socioeconomic position sep sex and ethnicity this cross sectional study utilizes data from the national survey of american life a nationally representative sample of african americans and caribbean blacks aged years and older multivariate logistic regression models stratified by ethnicity and sex describe the independent associations between obesity and multilevel socioeconomic factors after adjustment for age other sep measures at the individual family and neighborhood levels and health behaviors such as physical activity alcohol intake and smoking a positive relationship was observed between obesity and family income among african american and caribbean black men receipt of public assistance was a strongly associated factor for obesity in caribbean black men and women among african american women inverse relationships were observed between obesity and education occupation and family income residence within a neighborhood with a supermarket also decreased their odds of obesity residence in a neighborhood with a park decreased the odds of obesity only among african american men whereas residence in a neighborhood with a supermarket decreased the odds of obesity among caribbean black men the social patterning of obesity by individual household and neighborhood socioeconomic resources differs for african american and caribbean black men and women within these cross sectional analyses an appreciation of these differences may be a prerequisite for developing effective weight control interventions and policies for these two populations

Text: endovascular therapy and ethnic disparities in stroke outcomes background and purpose ethnic disparities in stroke are well described with a higher incidence of disability and increased mortality in blacks versus whites we sought to compare the clinical outcomes between those ethnic groups after stroke endovascular therapy et methods we performed a retrospective review of the prospectively acquired grady endovascular stroke outcomes registry between september and september patients were dichotomized into two groups caucasians and african americans and matched for age pretreatment glucose level and baseline national institutes of health stroke scale nihss score baseline characteristics as well as procedural and outcome parameters were compared results out of the patients treated with et pairs of patients n underwent primary analysis african americans were younger p had a higher prevalence of hypertension p and diabetes p and had higher alberta stroke program early ct score values p and shorter times to treatment p blacks more frequently had medicaid coverage and less private insurance vs and vs respectively p the remaining baseline characteristics including baseline nihss score and ct perfusion derived ischemic core volumes were well balanced there were no differences in the overall distribution of day modified rankin scale scores p rates of successful reperfusion vs p good outcomes vs p or parenchymal hematomas vs p blacks had lower day mortality rates vs p in univariate analysis which persisted as a nonsignificant trend after adjustment for potential confounders or ci p conclusions despite unique baseline characteristics african americans treated with et for large vessel occlusion strokes have similar outcomes as caucasians greater availability of et may diminish the ethnic racial disparities in stroke outcomes

Text: disproportionate covid related mortality amongst african americans in four southern states in the united states background african american have been severely affected by covid noted with the rising mortality rates within the african american community health disparities health inequities and issues with systemic health access are some of the pre existing issues african american were subjected to within the southern states in the united states second social distancing is a critical non pharmacological intervention to reduce the spread of covid however social distancing was not practical and presented a challenge within the african american community specifically in the southern states objective this article assesses the effect of covid on african american in the southern states methodology this short communication queried the publicly available department of health statistics on covid related mortality and underlying health conditions in four southern states alabama al georgia ga louisiana la and mississippi ms with a high proportion of african american residents second unacast covid toolkit was used to derive a social distancing sd grade for any given state based on three different metrics i percent change in average distance travelled ii percent change in non essential visits and iii decrease in human encounters compared to national baseline results across the four states on average as many as of covid related deaths are in the african american community although this minority group comprises only of the population cumulatively this article finds that all four southern states received a social distancing grade of f covid have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes cardiovascular diseases or pre existing pulmonary compromise conclusion recognizing that there is a great need for african american representation or diversity in the health workforce would be able to better address the health disparities in addition the lack of diversity in the healthcare system causes the morbidity and mortality rates to increase in the african american communities because it is not able to address its primary obligations within the african american communities in the southern states during covid pandemic these primary obligations are to restore protect improve health and to suppress health disparities and inequalities of covid within in the african american communities keywords covid african american mortality
