Text: reduced inflammatory responses to sars cov infection in children presenting to hospital with covid in china background infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in children is associated with better outcomes than in adults the inflammatory response to covid infection in children remains poorly characterised methods we retrospectively analysed the medical records of laboratory confirmed covid patients aged month to years from wuhan and jingzhou of hubei province patients presented between january th and march th information on clinical features laboratory results plasma cytokines chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed findings children admitted to hospital with covid were more likely to be male and the median age was iqr years all but one patient with severe disease was aged under and the majority had significant co morbidities despite having viral pneumonia on ct scanning only patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin il il il tumour necrosis factor tnf alpha and interferon ifn gamma between patients with mild moderate or severe disease interpretations we demonstrated that the immune responses of children to covid infection is significantly different from that seen in adults our evidence suggests that sars cov does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or cytokine storm in children with covid and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease these data also imply anti cytokine therapies may not be effective in children with moderate covid

Text: coronavirus covid infection in children at a specialist centre outcome and implications of underlying high risk comorbidities in a paediatric population background there is evolving evidence of significant differences in severity and outcomes of coronavirus disease covid in children compared to adults underlying medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease are based on adult data but have been applied across all ages resulting in large numbers of families undertaking social shielding vulnerable group we conducted a retrospective analysis of children with suspected covid at a specialist childrens hospital to determine outcomes based on covid testing status and underlying health vulnerabilities methods routine clinical data were extracted retrospectively from the institutions electronic health record system and digital research environment for patients with suspected and confirmed covid diagnoses data were compared between sars cov positive and negative patients covpos covneg respectively and in relation to presence of underlying health vulnerabilities based on public health england guidance findings between st march and th may children years of age presented to a specialist childrens hospital with clinical features of possible covid infection patients tested positive for sars cov virus covpos patients were older median years vs median years respectively p there was a significantly reduced proportion of vulnerable cases vs p but no difference in proportion of vulnerable patients requiring ventilation vs p between covpos and covneg groups however a significantly lower proportion of covpos patients required mechanical ventilation support compared to covneg patients vs p mortality was not significantly different between covpos and covneg groups vs respectively p although there were no direct covid related deaths in this highly preselected paediatric population interpretation covid infection may be associated with severe disease in childhood presenting to a specialist hospital but does not appear significantly different in severity to other causes of similar clinical presentations in children presenting with pre existing covid vulnerable medical conditions at a specialist centre there does not appear to be significantly increased risk of either contracting covid or severe complications apart from those undergoing chemotherapy who are over represented
