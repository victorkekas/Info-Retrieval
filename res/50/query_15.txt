Text: effectiveness of social networks for studying biological agents and identifying cancer biomarkers social networks form phenomena that exist and evolve they are dynamic these phenomena have been realized and studied by the anthropology and sociology research communities since however the recent rapid development in information technology and the internet has increased the interest in social networks and as a model they have been adapted to more applications and domains though researchers first studied social networks of humans for our study described in this chapter we argue that genes and proteins act collaboratively and exist in communities analogous to humans animals insects etc they complement each other and collectively achieve specific tasks where some would have major roles appearing upfront and others may play minor background roles however molecules turn into aggressive actors when their internal structure is augmented consequently they may deviate from their target change camp and disturb other molecules leading to disaster such mutations may be uncontrolled and unintentionally occur inside a body or they may be intentional and controlled by humans to serve one of two purposes treatment or bioterrorism in other words mutation in the molecules genes can lead to a change in behavior this may lead to good or bad effect e g recovery from illness or diseases that may severely affect the body causing disability or death once mutated outside the body molecules may turn into harmful biological weapons of mass destruction the latter process does not require sophisticated equipment and hence is extremely dangerous with the uprising global terrorism activities bioterrorism is therefore a serious concern for humanity one could say that mutated biological agents outside the body once misused could be way more dangerous than mutated molecules within the body in this chapter we will elaborate on bioterrorism and its consequences we will also propose a model to study social networks of genes within the body leading to the identification of disease biomarkers

Text: chapter molecular basis of pulmonary disease publisher summary pulmonary pathology includes a large spectrum of both neoplastic and non neoplastic diseases that affect the lung many of these are a result of the unusual relationship of the lung with the outside world every breath that a human takes brings the outside world into the body in the form of infectious agents organic and inorganic particles and noxious agents of all types although the lung has many defense mechanisms to protect itself from these insults these are not infallible therefore lung pathology arises damage to the lung is particularly important given the role of the lung in the survival of the organism any impairment of lung function has widespread effects throughout the body since all organs depend on the lungs for the oxygen they need pulmonary pathology catalogs the changes in the lung tissues and the mechanisms through which these occur this chapter presents a review of lung pathology and the current state of knowledge about the pathogenesis of each disease it suggests that a clear understanding of both morphology and mechanism is required for the development of new therapies and preventive measures

Text: estimating number of global importations of covid from wuhan risk of transmission outside mainland china and covid introduction index between countries outside mainland china background the emergence of a novel coronavirus sars cov in wuhan china in early december has caused widespread transmission within the country with over deaths reported to date other countries have since reported coronavirus disease covid importation from china with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside china we aim to estimate the number of cases imported from wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland china and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside china methods we used the reported number of cases imported from wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from wuhan to each location outside mainland china this uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model a covid introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between country connectivity results we identified countries or territories outside mainland china that may have under detected covid importation from wuhan such as thailand and indonesia in addition countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding including four outside asia the covid introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland china from which cases may be imported to each recipient country conclusions as sars cov continues to spread globally more epicentres may emerge outside china hence it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside china even before local transmission in a source country becomes known

Text: decoding the global outbreak of covid the nature is behind the scene the sudden emergence of sars cov causing the global pandemic is a major public health concern though the virus is considered as a novel entity it is not a completely new member it is just a new version of previously emerged human sars corona virus the rapid evolving nature by changing host body environment and extreme environmental stability collectively makes sars cov into an extremely virulent genetic variant the evolution of the virus has been occurred by the continuous process of molecular genetic manipulation through mutation deletion and genetic recombinationevents different host body environment acts as the supportive system for the pathogen which creates extreme selective pressure by the process of genetic evolution the pathogen developes new characters then the new version of the virus has been naturally selected by susceptible human host and adapt itself inside the host body causing deadly effect moreover extreme environmental stability helps in the process of viral survival outside the host and its transmission thus both the host body or internal environment and the external environment performs equally as a source responsible for shaping the genetic evolution of the sars cov towards thecovid disease fitness in nature in a pandemic form

Text: seasonality and selective trends in viral acute respiratory tract infections abstract influenza a and b and many unrelated viruses including rhinovirus rsv adenovirus metapneumovirus and coronavirus share the same seasonality since these viral acute respiratory tract infections varis are much more common in winter than summer unfortunately early investigations that used recycled pedigree virus strains seem to have led microbiologists to dismiss the common folk belief that varis often follow chilling today incontrovertible evidence shows that ambient temperature dips and host chilling increase the incidence and severity of varis this review considers four possible mechanisms m that can explain this link m increased crowding in winter may enhance viral transmission m lower temperatures may increase the stability of virions outside the body m chilling may increase host susceptibility m lower temperatures or host chilling may activate dormant virions there is little evidence for m or m which are incompatible with tropical observations epidemiological anomalies such as the repeated simultaneous arrival of varis over wide geographical areas the rapid cessation of influenza epidemics and the low attack rate of influenza within families are compatible with m but not m in its simple form m seems to be the main driver of seasonality but m may also play an important role
