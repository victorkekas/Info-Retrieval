Text: how long does coronavirus survive on different surfaces dental practices now need to be more vigilant than ever and pay extra attention to hygiene in the surgery hospitals are currently operating an hourly total clean policy and it would be prudent for dental practices to look to operate something similar to reduce the possibility of viral transmission the government is encouraging people to stay at home and maintain social distancing during the pandemic however key workers must go to work use public transport and mix with high risk people people also need to go to supermarkets to get their groceries the surfaces in these public places are likely to be contaminated these germs can then be brought into homes or dental practices

Text: effects of air temperature and relative humidity on coronavirus survival on surfaces assessment of the risks posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars cov on surfaces requires data on survival of this virus on environmental surfaces and on how survival is affected by environmental variables such as air temperature at and relative humidity rh the use of surrogate viruses has the potential to overcome the challenges of working with sars cov and to increase the available data on coronavirus survival on surfaces two potential surrogates were evaluated in this study transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and mouse hepatitis virus mhv were used to determine effects of at and rh on the survival of coronaviruses on stainless steel at degrees c infectious virus persisted for as long as days and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at rh inactivation was more rapid at degrees c than at degrees c at all humidity levels the viruses persisted for to days and the slowest inactivation occurred at low rh both viruses were inactivated more rapidly at degrees c than at degrees c the relationship between inactivation and rh was not monotonic and there was greater survival or a greater protective effect at low rh and high rh than at moderate rh there was also evidence of an interaction between at and rh the results show that when high numbers of viruses are deposited tgev and mhv may survive for days on surfaces at ats and rhs typical of indoor environments tgev and mhv could serve as conservative surrogates for modeling exposure the risk of transmission and control measures for pathogenic enveloped viruses such as sars cov and influenza virus on health care surfaces
