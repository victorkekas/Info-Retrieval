Text: how long does coronavirus survive on different surfaces dental practices now need to be more vigilant than ever and pay extra attention to hygiene in the surgery hospitals are currently operating an hourly total clean policy and it would be prudent for dental practices to look to operate something similar to reduce the possibility of viral transmission the government is encouraging people to stay at home and maintain social distancing during the pandemic however key workers must go to work use public transport and mix with high risk people people also need to go to supermarkets to get their groceries the surfaces in these public places are likely to be contaminated these germs can then be brought into homes or dental practices

Text: how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces a systematic review background inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces methods the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions in addition cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included results most gram positive bacteria such as enterococcus spp including vre staphylococcus aureus including mrsa or streptococcus pyogenes survive for months on dry surfaces many gram negative species such as acinetobacter spp escherichia coli klebsiella spp pseudomonas aeruginosa serratia marcescens or shigella spp can also survive for months a few others such as bordetella pertussis haemophilus influenzae proteus vulgaris or vibrio cholerae however persist only for days mycobacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis and spore forming bacteria including clostridium difficile can also survive for months on surfaces candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to months on surfaces persistence of other yeasts such as torulopsis glabrata was described to be similar months or shorter candida parapsilosis days most viruses from the respiratory tract such as corona coxsackie influenza sars or rhino virus can persist on surfaces for a few days viruses from the gastrointestinal tract such as astrovirus hav polio or rota virus persist for approximately months blood borne viruses such as hbv or hiv can persist for more than one week herpes viruses such as cmv or hsv type and have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to days conclusion the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed

Text: droplet evaporation residue indicating sars cov survivability on surfaces sars cov survives and remains viable on surfaces for several days under different environments as reported in recent studies however it is unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies across different surfaces to address these questions we conduct systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human exhaled gas on surfaces we found that these droplets do not disappear with evaporation but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers referred to as residues persist for more than hours and are highly durable against changes of environmental conditions the characteristics of these residues change significantly across surface types specifically surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable residues while stainless steel plastic and glass surfaces form residues from a varying fraction of all deposited droplets at relative humidity lowering humidity level suppresses the formation of residues while increasing humidity level enhances it our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes allowing them to survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition our findings can also be extended to other viruses transmitted through respiratory droplets e g sars cov flu viruses etc and can thus lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces and other prevention measures e g humidity control for limiting viral transmission

Text: can homeopathy a particularly mild therapeutic approach survive and grow in a world of violence this short treatise addresses a philosophical question concerning the place of homeopathy in our modern world the question raised is whether a therapeutic system as peaceful mild and non violent as homeopathy can survive and grow within a society that often displays the opposite characteristics much of contemporary society is more interested in fast and impressive cures even if these may also bring side effects whereas homeopathy can offer solutions with a personalized approach that requires long hours of case study by the homeopath to find the correct personal remedy that aims to bring about positive results which the therapy can produce in deep chronic diseases the conclusion drawn is that homeopathy does not readily fit within a modern and violent society that prefers quick and invasive solutions to its clinical problems

Text: adhesion of microdroplets on water repellent surfaces toward the prevention of surface fouling and pathogen spreading by respiratory droplets biofouling caused by the adhesion of respiratory microdroplets generated in sneezing and coughing plays an important role in the spread of many infectious diseases although water repellent surfaces are widely used for the long term repellency of aqueous solutions their repellency to pathogen containing microdroplets is elusive in this work microdroplets from picoliter to nanoliter were successfully generated in a controlled manner to mimic the exhaled microdroplets in sneezing and coughing which allowed us to evaluate the adhesion of microdroplets on both superhydrophobic and lubricant infused slippery surfaces for the first time the impact and retention of water microdroplets on the two water repellent surfaces are compared and investigated microdroplet mediated surface biofouling and pathogen transmission were also demonstrated our results suggested that the adhesion of microdroplets should be duly considered in the design and application of water repellent surfaces on biofouling prevention

Text: methusaleh s zoo how nature provides us with clues for extending human health span as impressive as the accomplishments of modern molecular biologists have been in finding genetic alterations that lengthen life in short lived model organisms they pale in comparison to the remarkable diversity of lifespans produced by evolution some animal species are now firmly documented to live for more than four centuries and even some mammals like the bowhead whale appear to survive years or more another group of species may not be as absolutely long lived but they are remarkably long lived for their body size and metabolic rate these species include a number of bats some of which live for at least years in the wild as well as the naked mole rat which is the same size but lives nearly times as long as the laboratory mouse together these exceptionally long lived organisms have important roles to play in our future understanding of the causal mechanisms and modulation of ageing bats and naked mole rats in particular have already contributed in the following ways they have contributed to the abandonment of the rate of living theory and weakened enthusiasm for the oxidative stress hypothesis of ageing they have helped evaluate how the tumour suppressing role of cellular senescence is affected by the evolution of diverse body sizes as well as diverse longevities they have shed light on the relationship between specific types of dna repair and ageing and they have yielded insight into new processes specifically the maintenance of the proteome and hypotheses concerning how evolution shapes ageing the continuing acceleration of progress in genome sequencing and development of more and more cross species investigatory techniques will facilitate even more contributions of these species in the near future

Text: murine olfactory bulb interneurons survive infection with a neurotropic coronavirus viral infection of the central nervous system cns is complicated by the mostly irreplaceable nature of neurons as the loss of neurons has the potential to result in permanent damage to brain function however whether neurons or other cells in the cns sometimes survive infection and the effects of infection on neuronal function is largely unknown to address this question we used the rjhm strain rj of mouse hepatitis virus mhv a neurotropic coronavirus that causes acute encephalitis in susceptible strains of mice to determine whether neurons or other cns cells survive acute infection with this virulent virus we developed a recombinant jhmv that expresses cre recombinase rj cre and infected mice that universally expressed a silent floxed version of tdtomato infection of these mice with rj cre resulted in expression of tdtomato in host cells the results showed that some cells were able to survive the infection as demonstrated by continued tdtomato expression after virus antigen could no longer be detected most notably interneurons in the olfactory bulb which are known to be inhibitory represented a large fraction of the surviving cells in conclusion our results indicated that some neurons are resistant to virus mediated cell death and provide a framework for studying the effects of prior coronavirus infection on neuron function importance we developed a novel recombinant virus that allows the study of cells that survive an infection by a central nervous system specific strain of murine coronavirus using this virus we identified neurons and to a lesser extent nonneuronal cells in the brain that were infected during the acute phase of the infection and survived for approximately weeks until the mice succumbed to the infection we focused on neurons and glial cells within the olfactory bulb because the virus enters the brain at this site our results show that interneurons of the olfactory bulb were the primary cell type able to survive infection further these results indicate that this system will be useful for functional and gene expression studies of cells in the brain that survive acute infection

Text: oligodendrocytes that survive acute coronavirus infection induce prolonged inflammatory responses in the cns neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus mhv a coronavirus cause acute and chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitis with similarities to the human disease multiple sclerosis here using a lineage tracking system we show that some cells primarily oligodendrocytes ols and oligodendrocyte precursor cells opcs survive the acute mhv infection are associated with regions of demyelination and persist in the central nervous system cns for at least d these surviving ols express major histocompatibility complex mhc class i and other genes associated with an inflammatory response notably the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration was variable dependent on anatomic location within the cns and without obvious correlation with numbers of surviving cells we detected more demyelination in regions with larger numbers of t cells and microglia macrophages compared to those with fewer infiltrating cells conversely in regions with less inflammation these previously infected ols more rapidly extended processes consistent with normal myelinating function together these results show that ols are inducers as well as targets of the host immune response and demonstrate how a cns infection even after resolution can induce prolonged inflammatory changes with cns region dependent impairment in remyelination
