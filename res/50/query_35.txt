Text: does non covid lung lesion help investigating transferability in covid ct image segmentation coronavirus disease covid is a highly contagious virus spreading all around the world deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid covid detection and segmentation from computed tomography ct images the major challenge lies in the inadequate public covid datasets recently transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem however it remains unclear whether various non covid lung lesions could contribute to segmenting covid infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure this paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non covid lung lesions based on a publicly available covid ct dataset and three public non covid datasets we evaluate four transfer learning methods using d u net as a standard encoder decoder method the results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non covid lung lesions and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features leading to accurate and robust pre trained models we further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence in addition our proposed multi encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non covid datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement these findings promote new insights into transfer learning for covid ct image segmentation which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks

Text: twitter sentiment classification for measuring public health concerns an important task of public health officials is to keep track of health issues such as spreading epidemics in this paper we are addressing the issue of spreading public concern about epidemics public concern about a communicable disease can be seen as a problem of its own keeping track of trends in concern about public health and identifying peaks of public concern are therefore crucial tasks however monitoring public health concerns is not only expensive with traditional surveillance systems but also suffers from limited coverage and significant delays to address these problems we are using twitter messages which are available free of cost are generated world wide and are posted in real time we are measuring public concern using a two step sentiment classification approach in the first step we distinguish personal tweets from news i e non personal tweets in the second step we further separate personal negative from personal non negative tweets both these steps consist themselves of two sub steps in the first sub step of both steps our programs automatically generate training data using an emotion oriented clue based method in the second sub step we are training and testing three different machine learning ml models with the training data from the first sub step this allows us to determine the best ml model for different datasets furthermore we are testing the already trained ml models with a human annotated disjoint dataset based on the number of tweets classified as personal negative we compute a measure of concern moc and a timeline of the moc we attempt to correlate peaks of the moc timeline to peaks of the news non personal timeline our best accuracy results are achieved using the two step method with a na√Øve bayes classifier for the epidemic domain six datasets and the mental health domain three datasets

Text: oscillations in usa covid incidence and mortality data reflect societal factors the covid pandemic currently in process differs from other infectious disease calamities that have previously plagued humanity in the vast amount of information that is produces each day which includes daily estimates of the disease incidence and mortality data apart from providing actionable information to public health authorities on the trend of the pandemic the daily incidence reflects the process of disease in a susceptible population and thus reflects the pathogenesis of covid the public health response and diagnosis and reporting both daily new cases and daily mortality data in the us exhibit periodic oscillatory patterns by analyzing nyc and la testing data we demonstrate that this oscillation in the number of cases can be strongly explained by the daily variation in testing this seems to rule out alternative hypotheses such as increased infections on certain days of the week as driving this oscillation similarly we show that the apparent oscillation in mortality in the us data is mostly an artifact of reporting which disappears in datasets that record death by episode date such as the nyc and la datasets periodic oscillations in covid incidence and mortality data reflect testing and reporting practices and contingencies thus these contingencies should be considered first prior to suggesting social or biological mechanisms

Text: improving multi turn response selection models with complementary last utterance selection by instance weighting open domain retrieval based dialogue systems require a considerable amount of training data to learn their parameters however in practice the negative samples of training data are usually selected from an unannotated conversation data set at random the generated training data is likely to contain noise and affect the performance of the response selection models to address this difficulty we consider utilizing the underlying correlation in the data resource itself to derive different kinds of supervision signals and reduce the influence of noisy data more specially we consider a main complementary task pair the main task i e our focus selects the correct response given the last utterance and context and the complementary task selects the last utterance given the response and context the key point is that the output of the complementary task is used to set instance weights for the main task we conduct extensive experiments in two public datasets and obtain significant improvement in both datasets we also investigate the variant of our approach in multiple aspects and the results have verified the effectiveness of our approach

Text: using wavelets and spectral methods to study patterns in image classification datasets deep learning models extract before a final classification layer features or patterns which are key for their unprecedented advantageous performance however the process of complex nonlinear feature extraction is not well understood a major reason why interpretation adversarial robustness and generalization of deep neural nets are all open research problems in this paper we use wavelet transformation and spectral methods to analyze the contents of image classification datasets extract specific patterns from the datasets and find the associations between patterns and classes we show that each image can be written as the summation of a finite number of rank patterns in the wavelet space providing a low rank approximation that captures the structures and patterns essential for learning regarding the studies on memorization vs learning our results clearly reveal disassociation of patterns from classes when images are randomly labeled our method can be used as a pattern recognition approach to understand and interpret learnability of these datasets it may also be used for gaining insights about the features and patterns that deep classifiers learn from the datasets

Text: candidate genes associated with susceptibility for sars coronavirus assuming that no human had any previously acquired immunoprotection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov during the sars outbreak the biological bases for possible difference in individual susceptibility are intriguing however this issue has never been fully elucidated based on the premise that sars patients belonging to a given genotype group having a significantly higher sars infection rate than others would imply that genotype group being more susceptible we make use of a compartmental model describing disease transmission dynamics and clinical and gene data of laboratory confirmed sars patients from chinese han population in taiwan to estimate the infection rates of distinct candidate genotype groups among these sars infected individuals the results show that cxcl aa is always protective whenever it appears but appears rarely and only jointly with either fgl t or ho a while fgl t is associated with higher susceptibility unless combined with cxcl ip aa when jointly is associated with lower susceptibility the novel modeling approach proposed which does not require sizable case and control gene datasets could have important future public health implications in swiftly identifying potential high risk groups associated with being highly susceptible to a particular infectious disease
