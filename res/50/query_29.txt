Text: a brief overview of current drug repurposing approaches for covid management this brief overview is intended to shed light on the current drug repositioning also called drug repurposing in the therapeutics of the novel coronavirus disease which emerged in covid in this sense the repositioning drugs for new indications can offer a better risk versus reward trade off when compared to other drug development strategies given that it makes use of drugs whose safety profile are already understood nonetheless this approach allows healthcare professionals to promptly tackle the disease by investigating readily available drugs against it

Text: drug repurposing prediction for covid using probabilistic networks and crowdsourced curation severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two sars cov the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease covid pandemic represents an unprecedented global health challenge consequently a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame however developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic drug repurposing by contrast provides an attractive alternative as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements in this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs identifying drug repurposing opportunities for covid we demonstrate the value of this approach reporting on eight potential repurposing opportunities identified and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future studies

Text: overcoming cancer therapeutic bottleneck by drug repurposing ever present hurdles for the discovery of new drugs for cancer therapy have necessitated the development of the alternative strategy of drug repurposing the development of old drugs for new therapeutic purposes this strategy with a cost effective way offers a rare opportunity for the treatment of human neoplastic disease facilitating rapid clinical translation with an increased understanding of the hallmarks of cancer and the development of various data driven approaches drug repurposing further promotes the holistic productivity of drug discovery and reasonably focuses on target defined antineoplastic compounds the treasure trove of non oncology drugs should not be ignored since they could target not only known but also hitherto unknown vulnerabilities of cancer indeed different from targeted drugs these old generic drugs usually used in a multi target strategy may bring benefit to patients in this review aiming to demonstrate the full potential of drug repurposing we present various promising repurposed non oncology drugs for clinical cancer management and classify these candidates into their proposed administration for either mono or drug combination therapy we also summarize approaches used for drug repurposing and discuss the main barriers to its uptake
