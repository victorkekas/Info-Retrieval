Text: drug repurposing prediction for covid using probabilistic networks and crowdsourced curation severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two sars cov the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease covid pandemic represents an unprecedented global health challenge consequently a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame however developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic drug repurposing by contrast provides an attractive alternative as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements in this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs identifying drug repurposing opportunities for covid we demonstrate the value of this approach reporting on eight potential repurposing opportunities identified and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future studies

Text: computational studies of drug repurposing and synergism of lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir binding with sars cov protease against covid a novel coronavirus sars cov has caused a major outbreak in humans all over the world and it is the latest pandemic in the series of other infectious diseases the concept of drug repurposing has been used successfully for many years for known diseases considering the emergency and urgency drug repurposing concept is being explored for coronavirus disease covid as well recently the combination of three known drugs lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir has been proposed to control the virulence to a great extent in covid affected patients within hours hence we tried to understand the effect of synergism of these drugs against the sars cov protease using sequential docking studies as a result combination of three drugs showed a better binding energy than that of individual drugs further the complex was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to get insights into the stability of the complex considering the simultaneous interactions between three drugs and the protein the protein complexed with three drugs remained stable during the simulations hence these drugs can be explored further for drug repurposing against the successful inhibition of covid

Text: application of artificial intelligence in covid drug repurposing background and aim covid outbreak has created havoc and a quick cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has usage history in patients to resolve the current pandemic with technological advancements in artificial intelligence ai coupled with increased computational power the ai empowered drug repurposing can prove beneficial in the covid scenario methods the recent literature is studied and analyzed from various sources such as scopus google scholar pubmed and ieee xplore databases the search terms used are covid ai and drug repurposing results ai is implemented in the field design through the generation of the learning prediction model and performs a quick virtual screening to accurately display the output with a drug repositioning strategy ai can quickly detect drugs that can fight against emerging diseases such as covid this technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery planning treatment and reported outcomes of the covid patient being an evidence based medical tool conclusions thus there are chances that the application of the ai approach in drug discovery is feasible with prior usage experiences in patients few of the old drugs if shown active against sars cov can be readily applied to treat the covid patients with the collaboration of ai with pharmacology the efficiency of drug repurposing can improve significantly

Text: multi omics study revealing tissue dependent putative mechanisms of sars cov drug targets on viral infections and complex diseases drug target prioritisation for new targets and drug repurposing of existing drugs for covid treatment are urgently needed for the current pandemic here we pooled candidate drug targets of covid from clinical trial registries and the literature and estimated their putative causal effects in sars cov related tissues on complex human diseases by constructing a disease atlas of drug targets for covid we prioritise target disease associations as evidence of causality using robust mendelian randomization mr and colocalization evidence http epigraphdb org covid ctda triangulating these mr findings with historic drug trial information and the druggable genome we ranked and prioritised three genes dhodh itgb and jak targeted by three marketed drugs leflunomide cilengitide and baricitinib which may have repurposing potential with careful risk assessment this study evidences the value of our integrative approach in prioritising and repurposing drug targets which will be particularly applicable when genetic association studies of covid are available in the near future

Text: drug repurposing using computational methods to identify therapeutic options for covid purpose recently the world has been dealing with a new type of coronavirus called covid that in terms of symptoms is similar to the sars coronavirus unfortunately researchers could not find a registered therapy to treat the infection related to the virus yet regarding the fact that drug repurposing is a good strategy for epidemic viral infection we applied the drug repurposing strategy using virtual screening to identify therapeutic options for covid for this purpose five proteins of covid chymotrypsin like protease clpro papain like protease plpro cleavage site hr and rbd in spike protein were selected as target proteins for drug repositioning methods first five proteins of covid were built by homology modeling then fda approved drugs drugs were screened against cleavage site and rbd in spike protein via virtual screening one hundred and twenty eight fda approved drugs with the most favorable free binding energy were attached to the cleavage site and rbd in spike protein of these drugs drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects virtual screening was then performed for the selected drugs with ace clpro and plpro and hr and tmprss results according to the results glecaprevir paritaprevir simeprevir ledipasvir glycyrrhizic acid tmc and hesperidin showed highly favorably free binding energies with all tested target proteins conclusion the above mentioned drugs can be regarded as candidates to treat covid infections but further study on the efficiency of these drugs is also necessary

Text: repurposing therapeutics for covid rapid prediction of commercially available drugs through machine learning and docking background the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease covid caused by the sars cov virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past months as the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines so there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by sars cov methods and findings we perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery in other words repurposing of existing drugs the vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time recently remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in machine learning ml technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process consequently a detailed study using ml for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required here we report the ml model based on the naive bayes algorithm which has an accuracy of around to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of covid our study predicts around ten fda approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing among all we suggest that the antiretroviral drug atazanavir drugbank id db would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions conclusions our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for covid treatment the ml based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications
