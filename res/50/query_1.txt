Text: mosaic evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a deadly form of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus a viral family responsible for mild respiratory tract infections in a wide variety of animals including humans pigs cows mice cats and birds analyses to date have been unable to identify the precise origin of the sars coronavirus we used bayesian neighbor joining and split decomposition phylogenetic techniques on the sars virus replicase surface spike matrix and nucleocapsid proteins to reveal the evolutionary origin of this recently emerging infectious agent the analyses support a mammalian like origin for the replicase protein an avian like origin for the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins and a mammalian avian mosaic origin for the host determining spike protein a bootscan recombination analysis of the spike gene revealed high nucleotide identity between the sars virus and a feline infectious peritonitis virus throughout the gene except for a base pair region of high identity to an avian sequence these data support the phylogenetic analyses and suggest a possible past recombination event between mammalian like and avian like parent viruses this event occurred near a region that has been implicated to be the human receptor binding site and may have been directly responsible for the switch of host of the sars coronavirus from animals to humans

Text: origin of novel coronavirus covid a computational biology study using artificial intelligence origin of the covid virus has been intensely debated in the scientific community since the first infected cases were detected in december the disease has caused a global pandemic leading to deaths of thousands of people across the world and thus finding origin of this novel coronavirus is important in responding and controlling the pandemic recent research results suggest that bats or pangolins might be the original hosts for the virus based on comparative studies using its genomic sequences this paper investigates the covid virus origin by using artificial intelligence ai and raw genomic sequences of the virus more than genome sequences of covid infected cases collected from different countries are explored and analysed using unsupervised clustering methods the results obtained from various ai enabled experiments using clustering algorithms demonstrate that all examined covid virus genomes belong to a cluster that also contains bat and pangolin coronavirus genomes this provides evidences strongly supporting scientific hypotheses that bats and pangolins are probable hosts for the covid virus at the whole genome analysis level our findings also indicate that bats are more likely the hosts for the covid virus than pangolins
